It’s about engaging with customers in a natural, deep, and multi-dimensional way that goes far beyond what you might expect.\nBelow are\n5 common misconceptions about customer journey\nthat can derail even the best marketing strategies. Let’s see which ones you’ve encountered—or believed—yourself.\nWhat Is Customer Journey?\nBefore we dive into the misconceptions, let’s revisit the basics: what is customer journey?\nThe customer journey refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand—from the first moment of awareness, through the purchase decision, and ideally into brand loyalty. It encompasses every touchpoint across both online and offline channels, including seeing an ad, browsing a website, trying a sample, or even speaking with a customer service rep.\nUnderstanding the customer journey is fundamental to modern marketing—especially as consumer behaviors grow more complex and diverse than ever before.\n5 Misconceptions About Customer Journey You Might Not Know\n1. The Simpler the Journey, the Better\nMany brands mistakenly believe that the customer journey should be as short and simple as possible to encourage quick decision-making. However, oversimplifying the process can backfire—especially when it removes critical information that helps customers feel confident.\nTake health-conscious consumers as an example. They often need detailed product information, expert recommendations, and peer reviews. Stripping this down for the sake of \"simplicity\" could actually make their decision harder.\n2. All Customers Follow the Same Journey\nOne of the most common misconceptions about customer journey is thinking everyone follows the same path. In reality, customers buying the same product may do so for completely different reasons. One might purchase quickly due to familiarity, while another may need extensive reviews or compare value and brand image.\nAssuming a “one-size-fits-all” journey can cause your brand to miss opportunities to engage specific customer segments effectively.\n3. Repeat Customers Want Everything to Stay the Same\nEven with repeat purchases—like soap, toothpaste, or coffee—customers still crave variety and freshness. Brands often assume consistency means avoiding change altogether, but subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can add excitement and maintain engagement.\nConsistency is key—but so is keeping things interesting to sustain long-term interest.\n4. The Journey Ends at Purchase\nMany marketers think the customer journey ends once a sale is made. On the contrary, this is often when the most important part begins. Exceptional post-purchase service can lead to repeat business, loyalty, and word-of-mouth referrals.\nExtending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints is essential for increasing lifetime customer value.\n5. One Journey Works for All Seasons\nUsing the same customer journey strategy year-round—without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts—can make your marketing feel out of touch. For instance, during economic downturns, customers may prioritize value over luxury, so focusing on premium branding may not resonate.\nCustomer journeys must evolve with real-time insights and context to stay relevant and impactful.\nUse the Customer Journey Matrix to Make Better Business Decisions\nTo create more effective customer journey, many brands now use a customer journey matrix, which classifies journeys along two key axes: complexity (easy–hard) and predictability (predictable–unpredictable). This results in four journey types:\n1. Routine – Easy and Predictable\nFor everyday purchases like groceries or monthly services, predictable behavior allows for strategies like membership programs,\nloyalty programs\n, and auto-renewals.\n2. Joyride – Easy but Unpredictable\nProducts driven by emotion or impulse—such as gifts or snacks—benefit from emotional marketing, fun content, and flash sales that tap into spur-of-the-moment decision-making.\n3. Trek – Hard but Predictable\nBig-ticket or long-term commitments like insurance, education, or real estate require planning. Recommended tactics include informative content, free consultations, and trial access.\n4. Odyssey – Hard and Unpredictable\nThese journeys are typical of inspiration-based decisions, such as social impact startups or creative ventures. Successful strategies include brand storytelling, purpose-driven messaging, and community building.\nBy understanding these differences, brands can see that designing a customer journey isn’t about making everything easy—it’s about tailoring experiences to fit each audience, goal, and context.\nRethink the Journey: Build What Customers Really Need\nThe customer journey matrix allows you to account for emotional drivers, behavioral patterns, and shifting expectations—factors that a one-size-fits-all model can easily overlook. Relying on a single journey framework can make your messaging feel flat and limit your ability to build meaningful relationships.\nIf you're looking to create a professional customer journey strategy that truly fits your audience and drives long-term results, our team at Jenosize is here to help.

In their world, there is no boundary between reality and imagination, no framework for \"impossible\" or \"too difficult.\" Everything is an opportunity, and every limitation is a canvas for their creativity. They are the new generation who not only push beyond limits but redefine what \"limits\" mean altogether.\nLet's dive into the w\norld of Gen Beta. Who are they\n? How are they different from previous generations? And why should you start understanding them today? Because this generation isn’t just stepping into the future—they are the ones creating it!\nWhat is Gen Beta? Who are They?\nGen Beta refers to individuals b\norn from 2025 onwards.\nThey are the first generation to grow up in a truly digital world, living in an era where technology is seamlessly integrated into daily life. Unlike previous generations who had to adapt to technological changes,\nGeneration Beta will naturally coexist with technology as if it were second nature.\nWhat sets Gen Beta apart is the\nir unique bond with technology—\nit will be as intrinsic to them as\nWhat Will Generation Beta be Like?\nAdvanced Creativity\nGen Beta possesses b\noundless creativity, seamlessly blending technology with innovation in extraordinary ways. Their problem-solving methods go far beyond traditional approaches, embracing out-of-the-box thinking that previous generations might not have imagined.\nExpertise in Technology\nFor Generation Beta, technology\nisn’t just a tool—it’s their primary language for engaging with the world. They have an innate understanding of advanced technologies such as\nartificial intelligence (AI)\n, data analytics, and cutting-edge innovations, often requiring minimal effort to learn and adapt.\nData-Driven Decision-Making\nWhile Gen X and Gen Y tend to rely on personal experiences and advice from elders, and Gen Z draws insights from social media and online opinion\ns, Gen Beta ta\nkes it a step further. They base their decisions primarily on data and analytics. With exceptional skills in processing complex information, they can quickly grasp the big picture and make informed choices.\nEmphasis on Ethics and Sustainability\nGen Beta pl\naces significant value on sustainability and ethics. They are deeply committed to driving positive change in society and the environment, striving for tangible improvements that reflect their values.\nGeneration Beta Marketing Solutions\nCreate Content That Resonates and Reflects Their Identity\nContent aimed at Gen Beta must be\nthoughtful and meaningful. It should go beyond simply providing information to challenge traditional mindsets and encourage critical thinking. This generation values intellectual depth, diverse perspectives, and systematic connections between ideas.\nTo build credi\nbility, marketers should rely on insights from research and ensure transparency in data sources. Gen Beta pre\nfers to verify and analyze information themselves, making transparency a crucial factor in gaining their trust.\nUse Technology to Foster Connection\nTo align with Generation Beta marketing solutions, busin\nesses must innovate their communication strategies to provide seamless, personalized experiences. This includes leveraging platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or real-time customer interaction systems capable of understanding both context and emotions for smoother and more meaningful connections.\nHighlight Transparency and Sustainability Across Business Dimensions\nAs socially conscious individ\nuals, Gen Beta demands ta\nngible evidence of efforts to create a positive impact. Examples include detailed disclosures of production processes, demonstrations of social and environmental contributions, and clear sustainability metrics. These efforts significantly enhance trust and loyalty among this generation.\nFoster a Sense of Participation\nFor Generation Beta, engagement goes beyond listening—it’s about co-creating products and services with brands. Businesses should focus on fostering innovation spaces where Gen Beta can contribut\ne their creative ideas. This could involve platforms for brainstorming, opportunities to participate in product development, or rewards for innovative ideas.\nFor anyone who still sees Gen Z or Gen Alpha as the most noteworthy groups of this era, it’s time to rethink—Gen Beta is emerging and will surpass them in influence by leaps and bounds. The world they are growing up in isn’t just equipped with advanced tools; it’s a world they are designing themselves, from the economy to culture.\nThis is an era where human creativity and limitless potential will be harnessed to drive real change. Generation Beta is not merely the \"future\"; they are the force that will push us beyond the boundaries of imagination.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Or when searching for information on the internet, Google is often the first choice that comes to mind. This is the power of strong\n\"brand awareness\"\nthat has allowed these brands to dominate the hearts of consumers for a long time.\nHowever, in today's world, buildin\ng brand awareness has become more challenging than ever, with the increasing variety of communication channels, rapidly changing consumer\nbehavior, and fierce competition in the\nmarketing\nworld. Brands must unders\ntand what brand awareness strategy entails and the various levels that need to be gradually climbed.\nLet’s take a moment to revisit - What is Brand Awareness?\nBrand awareness refers to the le\nvel of a consumer's ability to recognize and identify a brand through various elements\n, such as its name, logo, slogan, or unique characteristics that stand out.\nThe reason businesses need to prioritize\nbrand awareness strategy is becaus\ne brand recognition acts as a bridge between consumers and the brand. Through creating a lasting impression and positive memories, it builds a strong long-term relationship. This recognition can occur through various channels, such as seeing advertisements, hearing word-of-mouth, or personal experiences with the products and services.\nWhat are the Levels of Brand Awareness?\nBrand awareness does not occur instant\nly; it develops in different stages. These stages can be divided into four main levels:\nLevel 1: Zero Awareness - The Starting Point for Every Brand\nAt this initial stage, consumers are unaware of the brand. It is like being a stranger in the market, a significant challenge for new brands that need to create awareness of their existence. The focus is on introducing the brand to consumers through various channels, and planning marketing efforts to create initial recognition.\nLevel 2: Brand Recognition - Recognize or Recall the Brand When Seen\nAt this level of brand awareness, consumers begin\nto recognize the brand when they see or hear it, though they may not automatically think of it on their own. Recognition might include:\nThe ability to remember the logo, color, or unique design of the brand.\nFamiliarity with seeing the product on store shelves.\nAssociating the brand with a certain category of products or services.\nLevel 3: Brand Recall - The Brand That Comes to Mind When Needed\nAt this level, consumers can recall the brand without needing external cues such as products, logos, or advertisements. This is a deeper form of memory recall that is embedded in long-term memory. Consumers can identify the brand when thinking about a certain product category.\nThe brand often appears in the list of options consumers consider when purchasing.\nConsumers understand the brand’s value and unique qualities.\nLevel 4: Top of Mind - The First Brand in the Consumer’s Mind\nBeing the number one brand in the consumer’s mind is the pinnacl\ne of brand awareness that every business strives to reach. When a brand achieves this level, it means the busine\nss has become the representative of the product or service category by default.\nThe brand is the first that comes to mind in its product category.\nIt earns trust and loyalty from consumers.\nIt has a high influence on purchasing decisions.\nIt can set market direction and holds significant business leverage.\nWhat are the Strategies for Building Brand Awareness Campaign?\n﻿Find a Clear Brand Position\nEstablishing a clear brand position is essential for building a strong brand foundation. Consider the following components:\nMarket and Competitor Analysis:\nStudy market gaps that are not being addressed, analyze competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and identify opportunities to differentiate your brand.\nUnderstand the Target Audience:\nStudy consumer behavior and needs, understand the challenges they face, and identify the values that are important to them.\nDefine the Core Brand Values:\nCreate a distinctive and unique position, set clear missions and visions, and develop values that align with market needs.\nBuild a Strong Brand Identity\nBrand Identity must effectively communicate the brand’s personality and values. This includes:\nVisual Elements:\nCreate an easily recognizable logo that conveys meaning, unique color schemes, and a design style that aligns with the brand’s values.\nCommunication Elements:\nDefine the brand's tone of voice and personality in communication, craft memorable and catchy slogans, and establish a unique language and presentation style.\nTell the Brand Story\nEffective storytelling can help create a deeper emotional connection with consumers. Key factors for a compelling brand story include:\nGood Story Components:\nThe brand’s origins and inspiration, the values and beliefs the brand holds, and the brand’s mission to its customers and society.\nEmotional Connection:\nShare experiences and successes, showcase impactful customer stories, or inspire through storytelling.\nUse Diverse Marketing Techniques\nYou don’t have to rely on just one technique in marketing; you can combine different marketing tools to reach your target audience more effectively. These techniques include:\nPublic Relations (PR):\nCreate interesting news, organize engaging events, or build strong relationships with media outlets.\nSEO:\nDevelop content that satisfies both readers and search engines, optimize your website to rank in search results, and build quality backlinks.\nSocial Media Content:\nCreate engaging content that encourages sharing, use various presentation formats, and consistently engage with your followers.\nRemember that creating\na successful brand awareness strategy requires a blend of creativity, consistency, and a deep understanding of consumer behavior. If done correctly, your brand will not only become recognized but will also become the first cho\nice for consumers in the long term.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

The key to turning those prospects into actual customers lies in lead nurturing—the process of building relationships with l\neads to guide them toward a purchasing decision.\nAs a\ndigital marketing agency\nwith extensive experien\nce in crafting digital marketing strategies, we can confidently say that the most crucial aspect of turning leads into customers is designing the right experience at every stage of the customer journey. By leveraging behavioral data, customer interests, and pain points, we can create tailored offers that effectively addres\ns their needs.\nWhat is Lead Nurturing?\nLead nurturing is the process of continuously building and mainta\nining relationships with potential customers—from the moment they first discover your brand to the final purchasing decision. It’s like cultivating a meaningful connection between a brand and its prospects by delivering relevant information that aligns with their needs and interests at each stage of the\nbuying cycle\nor customer journey.\nThe primary goal of lead nurturing is to help prospects gain a deep understanding of your products and services while fostering trust in your brand. This process is not solely focused on driving sales but rather on establishing long-term, valuable relationships. In simple terms, lead nurturing is about turning leads into customers.\n4 Reasons Why Lead Nurturing is Essential for Your Business\nIncreases Sales Conversion Rates\nEffecti\nve lead nurturing significantly boosts sales conversion rates by providing potential customers with the right information at the right time\n. When prospects receive relevant and sufficient details that match their needs, they can make confident purchasing decisions. According to\nHubSpot\n, businesses that implement lead nurturing strategies can increase sales by up to 50% compared to those that don’t.\nReduces Customer Acquisition Costs\nHubSpot also reports that companies that maintain relationships with existing leads spend 33% less on customer acquisition compared to those constantly seeking new customers. This highlights lead nurturing as a cost-effective marketing strategy, as it focuses on developing relationships with high-potential leads rather than spending excessive resources on attracting new ones.\nBuilds Brand Loyalty\nLead nurturing is not just about securing the first purchase—it fo\nsters long-term relationships that lead to repeat business and referrals. Customers who receive ongoing engagement and support from a brand are more likely to develop brand loyalty, ensuring sustained business growth.\nProvides Deeper Insights into Customer Behavior\nBy impleme\nnting lead nurturing strategies,\nbusinesses can collect and\nanalyze detailed data on prospect behavior\nand preferences. This allows for the optimization of products, services, and marketing strategies to better meet customer needs, ultimately increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction.\nWinning Customers’ Hearts with Lead Nurturing Strategies\nDeliver Personalized Content for Maximum Engagement\nPersonalized content makes communication more relevant and engaging by tailoring messages based on website behavior, purchase history, interests, preferences, and demographic data. By customizing content to match each lead’s needs, businesses can boost engagement rates and\nincrease sales conversions\n.\nAutomate Email Marketing for Seamless Communication\nSetting up Email Automation allows brands to send relevant messages automatically based on user behavior. This automation saves time and resources while maintaining continuous engagement with leads. Examples include:\nWelcome emails after newsletter sign-ups\nFollow-up emails after content downloads\nReminder emails for abandoned carts\nUse Retargeting Ads to Bring Back Potential Customers\nRetargeting Ads effectively re-engage users who have shown interest in your products or services. These ads display content related to what they previously searched for or browsed. However, it’s crucial to balance frequency and relevance to avoid overwhelming your audience.\nOffer Lead Magnets to Encourage Contact Information Sharing\nProviding valuable incentives encourages prospects to share their contact details, enabling further lead nurturing. These strategies help businesses gather high-quality lead data for nurturing and conversion. Examples of effective lead magnets include:\neBooks with in-depth insights\nWebinars featuring expert knowledge\nWhitepapers with industry research\nFree trials allowing firsthand product experience\n﻿\nCase Study: HubSpot's Lead Nurturing Strategy to Boost Conversion Rates\nHubSpot is a global software platform specializing in Inbound Marketing, CRM, and Marketing Automation. It helps businesses attract customers, build relationships, and convert leads into actual customers using various tools.\nWith a strong focus on Customer-Centric Marketing, HubSpot implemented lead nurturing strategies for increasing sales conversion rates, turning leads into customers, and fostering long-term customer relationships.\nStrategies Used\nEmail Automation:\nHubSpot sends automated emails tailored to the user’s behavior, such as sharing industry-specific articles or offering Free Trials based on individual interest levels.\nLead Scoring:\nHubSpot uses a lead scoring system, assigning points based on engagement, like downloading eBooks or repeatedly visiting the website. This helps the sales team prioritize high-potential leads.\nRetargeting Ads:\nHubSpot employs remarketing ads to target prospects who visited the website but didn’t make a purchase decision, encouraging them to return and complete their transaction.\nResults\nHubSpot increased its Conversion Rate by 50%.\nThe company reduced customer acquisition costs by 33%.\nEmail response rates increased 4 times compared to before.\nNow you know what is lead nurturing. It’s not just about traditional customer follow-up; it's about creating an experience that gradually bu\nilds a relationship with the brand, eventually leading to a purchasing decision. Working with a\ndigital marketing agency\nthat has expertise in this area will help ensure that strategies and execution are effective by integrating technology and understanding consumer behavior. When customers have a positive experience, they are more likely to make repeat purchases and recommend the brand to others. This, in turn, contributes to long-term, stable business growth.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Marketing Tips for This Group\n\"Glamorous,\" is quickly becoming a trend among consumers who value luxurious, premium, and unique products and services. For brands, this means the focus shouldn't be merely on selling ordinary goods or services but on\ndelivering experiences\nthat reflect the identity and ultimate aspirations of these target audiences. What they seek are symbols of social status, success, and an elevated lifestyle.\nWho is the Luxury Consumer or Luxumer?\nLuxumer, o\nr luxury consumer, refe\nrs to a group of consumers who prioritize luxury in every aspect of their lives.\nIt’s not just about purchasing high-end brand-name products but also embracing a lifestyle defined by exclusivity and sophistication. Luxumers are often characterized by their refined tastes, love for beauty, and willingness to pay a premium for the best of everything.\nThe defining traits\nof luxury consumers lie in their\nability to blend traditional luxury with the modern digital age. While they value expensive products as symbols of social status, they also emphasize intangible qualities such as uniqueness, sustainability, and memorable experiences.\nWhat is Luxury Marketing?\nTo connect with luxury consumers, brands must employ a specialized strategy known as Luxury Marketing. This approach focuses on delivering premium value and experiences to consumers, aiming to highlight the luxury, exclusivity, and uniqueness of the brand. The core of luxury marketing lies in fostering desirability and maintaining exclusivity through meticulously crafted marketing strategies.\nUnlike general marketing, luxury marketing (or luxumer marketing) does not prioritize price competition or promotional offers. Instead, it emphasizes creating emotio\nnal and social value while ensuring the premium quality of every touchpoint a consumer has with the brand.\nWhat do Luxury Consumers Want? 5 Luxumer Marketing Techniques to Attract the Glamorous\n1. Make the Brand More Than a Product – Be a Statement\nTo appe\nal to luxury consumers, brands must go beyo\nnd simply offering products or services and instead create meaningful value. This involves storytelling that reflects the identity and taste of consumers. For example, sharing a brand's rich history, the craftsmanship behind production, or a unique business philosophy can transform a product into a symbol of personal expression and refined taste.\n2. Deliver Exclusive Experiences\nLuxury consumers seek exceptional, tailored experiences. Providing exclusivity is crucial, whether through VIP events, p\nersonalized services, or limited-edition collections. Creating a sense of belonging through membership programs or exclusive perks is another highly effective strategy to foster brand loyalty.\n3. Communicate Luxury Through Visuals and Branding\nEvery interaction with the brand should exude luxury. From visual identity design, photography, and layout to the choice of colors, fonts, and graphic elements, every detail must convey premium quality and attention to detail. Communication should balance sophistication and modernity, ensuring the brand’s image resonates with its audience.\n4. Targeted and Insightful Communication\nUnderstanding luxumers’ insights deeply is essential. Study their behaviors, desires, and decision-making motivations to craft brand messages that align with their lifestyles and needs. This approach allows brands to address both functional and emotional needs effectively, ensuring the message resonates on every level.\n5. Digital-First but Human-Centric\nW\nhile luxury consumers are adep\nt at using technology, they still value personal interaction. Digital marketing should combine the convenience of technology with personalized, attentive service. For instance, AI can analyze consumer behavior to recommend tailored products, but human consultants should still be available to provide expert guidance and personal care.\nCase Studies: Successful Luxumer Marketing Examples\nGucci Vault Land\nGucci Vault Land stands out as a prime example of blending luxury heritage with\nmetaverse technology\n. This virtual platform allows users to explore Gucci’s vintage collections and limited-edition\nNFT items\n. By creating a digital space infused with luxury and creativity, Gucci not only attracts a new generatio\nn of luxury consumers bu\nt also reinforces its image as a forward-thinking brand that dares to push the boundaries of luxury.\nBang & Olufsen\nBang & Olufsen exemplifies successful Omnichannel experiences for premium customers. The Danish luxury audio brand has developed an application enabling users to customize audio system settings in detail, complemented by at-home installation and personalized maintenance services. This seamless integration of\nadvanced technology\nwith premium service highlights the brand’s deep understanding of consumers’ desire for both convenience and meticulous attention to detail.\nHermès Experience\nHermès showcases the power of creating lasting customer relationships through elevated experiences. The iconic luxury brand organizes exclusive workshops where clients can learn high-level craftsmanship directly from Hermès artisans. Additionally, rotating art and cultural exhibitions in key cities worldwide further strengthen bonds with clients while emphasizing the brand's timeless value and heritage.\nLuxury marketing goes beyond merely selling expensive products; it’s about creating a deep connection between the brand and its consumers. Luxury consumers seek more than just a product—they desire experiences that resonate with their identity and values. So, how do you market to win the hearts of Luxumers? The answer is simple: m\nake them feel like “no one understands me better than this brand.” When they feel this way, you don’t just gain a one-time customer—you gain a loyal partner for life.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nSingle Customer View: Know Your Customers Inside Out\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n182\n0\nSingle Customer View: Building a 360-Degree Customer Profile\nIn today's data-driven world, having accurate, real-time insights into your customers is key to staying competitive. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through Single Customer View (SCV)—a unified approach that consolidates customer data from all touchpoints into one comprehensive profile. With a complete view of each customer, brands can deliver more personalized, consistent, and meaningful experiences across channels.\nWhat Is Single Customer View (SCV)?\nSCV stands for Single Customer View, which refers to the process of aggregating customer data from various sources\n—such as websites, mobile apps, social media, email, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and customer service teams—and integrating it into a centralized system.\nWhen all data points are connected, businesses gain a 360-degree perspective of each customer’s behaviors, preferences, and interactions. This holistic view enables more informed decision-making, precise targeting, and tailored marketing strategies.\nBenefits of Single Customer View\nImplementing an effective SCV can transform how your brand interacts with customers. Below are the top benefits of Single Customer View for modern businesses:\nEnhance Personalization Efforts\nUp-to-date, comprehensive customer data allows brands to craft more relevant messages, offers, and campaigns. This reduces the feeling of being \"sold to\" and increases the likelihood of conversions.\nImprove Omnichannel Customer Experiences\nBy unifying data across all platforms, customers receive seamless and consistent service, no matter which channel they use to engage with your brand.\nIncrease Accuracy in Data Analysis and Forecasting\nWith clean, centralized data, analysts can more clearly identify customer behavior patterns and emerging trends. This results in more accurate forecasting and better-informed strategic decisions.\nReduce Costs and Operational Inefficiencies\nSCV helps eliminate duplicate or fragmented data, enabling sales, marketing, and customer service teams to operate more efficiently—saving time, reducing errors, and cutting unnecessary costs.\nHow to Create a Single Customer View\nWhile the concept of SCV may sound straightforward, building a complete and effective customer view requires the right tools, technologies, and strategic planning. Here's how to create a Single Customer View in your organization:\n1. Connect Data Across Platforms for a Clear Customer Picture\nCreating an SCV begins with collecting data from every customer touchpoint—website, mobile apps, social media channels, email systems, CRM platforms, and in-store POS systems. Though dispersed across different platforms, each data point provides valuable insights into customer behavior.\nBy accurately linking these data sets, brands can visualize the customer journey in real time and respond with tailored personalization. Tools like Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) and APIs can also streamline the integration process, ensuring all data is funneled into a single, centralized system without duplication or loss.\n2. Standardize and Cleanse Data\nOnce data is collected, the next challenge lies in harmonizing various formats and ensuring completeness. Different systems often record data inconsistently—mismatched name spellings, duplicate emails, or missing details.\nKey steps in this phase include:\nData Cleansing:\nRemoving errors and duplicates.\nData Standardization:\nUnifying formats (e.g., dates, geographic details).\nData Deduplication:\nMerging repeated records into one accurate entry.\nWithout these processes, the data cannot be effectively analyzed or used to build reliable customer profiles.\n3. Build 360-Degree Customer Profiles\nAfter cleansing and standardizing your data, the next step is to create a 360-degree customer profile. These profiles consolidate demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), behavioral data (e.g., site visits, purchase history), and customer interactions (e.g., chat history, support tickets) into one cohesive view.\nThese comprehensive profiles not only empower marketing teams to personalize campaigns more effectively but also enable seamless collaboration across departments—from sales and customer service to product development.\n4. Use Data to Drive Strategy and Customer Engagement\nWith well-organized data at your fingertips, your business can now refine its strategic efforts. SCV plays a crucial role in:\nPersonalization:\nUsing real customer insights to deliver relevant content, offers, and communications across the right channels.\nCustomer Journey Mapping:\nIdentifying where each customer is in the buying process to deliver timely, tailored content.\nMarketing Automation:\nAutomatically triggering personalized campaigns at optimal times to enhance the customer experience.\nA Single Customer View is more than just a data management strategy—it’s a powerful tool that allows businesses to understand and connect with their customers on a deeper level. By integrating and analyzing data from all touchpoints, companies can sharpen their marketing and sales strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver exceptional customer experiences.\nIn 2025 and beyond, brands looking to thrive in a competitive digital landscape must invest in building an SCV framework. Whether through in-house data architecture or partnerships with a\nconsulting company\n, establishing a long-term Single Customer View solution is essential for sustainable business growth.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Consumers are not merely the final buyers at the end of the sales chain; they play a variety of significant and diverse roles throughout the purchasing journey—roles that might be more complex than you expect.\nConsumer buying roles is a conceptual f\nramework that helps identify and classify the roles consumers play in the sales process. By understanding these roles, businesses can tailor their sales strategies to align with each role effectively, but where consumer behavior is becoming increasingly complex, many businesses are opting to collaborate with a\ndigital agency\nthat specializes in in-depth consumer analysis. This collaboration enables the development of precise and effective marketing strategies that align with the multifaceted roles of modern consumers.\nWhat are Consumer Buying Roles?\nConsumer buying roles refer to\nthe various roles played by individuals involved in the decision-making process for purchasing a product or service.\nIn any given purchase, multiple people may participate, each with distinct roles. Some individuals may even take on more than one role at a time.\nUnderstanding these consumer buying roles\nenables marketers to:\nPlan communication strategies that effectively target the right audience.\nCraft tailored content and marketing messages.\nSelect the most efficient communication channels.\nDevelop sales strategies that address the needs and expectations of all parties involved.\n8 Consumer Buying Roles Marketers Should Know\n1. The Decider\nThe decider is the individual with the ultimate authority to make the final purchasing decision. They evaluate the options and choose the product or service to buy.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nIn the context of buying a family car, a parent may decide on the model and specifications that best suit the family’s needs.\nMarketing Tip:\nProvide clear, comprehensive, and precise information to help the decider make confident and informed decisions.\n2. The Buyer\nThe buyer is responsible for carrying out the actual purchasing transaction. This person may or may not be the same as the decider.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example\n: A procurement officer in an organization may handle purchases based on approvals received.\nMarketing Tip:\nSimplify the purchasing process, ensure convenience, and offer flexible payment options to meet the buyer’s needs.\n3. The Approver\nThe approver has the authority to approve or reject the purchasing decision. This role is common in organizations with formal procurement processes.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nA finance manager may approve the budget for a purchase.\nMarketing Tip:\nFocus on presenting value-driven insights, emphasizing the return on investment and the benefits the organization will gain.\n4. The Promoter\nThe promoter is the person who initiates the purchase need and advocates for it to be fulfilled.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nAn employee recognizing the necessity for new technology in their organization and pushing for its adoption.\nMarketing Tip:\nEquip Promoters with the necessary information and tools to effectively communicate and justify their suggestions to decision-makers.\n5. The Executive Sponsor\nThe executive sponsor is a senior leader who champions a project or purchase, often driving organizational change. Their support is vital for securing approval and ensuring successful implementation.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nA Chief Operating Officer (COO) supports the procurement of a new CRM system to improve customer relationship management across the company.\nMarketing Tip:\nPresent a long-term vision and strategies that align with the organization’s goals to capture the Executive Sponsor’s interest and buy-in.\n6. The Influencer\nThe\ninfluencer\ndirectly or indirectly impacts purchasing decisions. They can be industry experts, bloggers, or close acquaintances who provide recommendations or endorsements.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nA prominent tech blogger writes a glowing review of a new smartphone, praising its innovative camera features and performance.\nMarketing Tip:\nBuild strong relationships with influencers by providing accurate and complete information. This empowers them to share your brand’s message effectively and expand its reach through word-of-mouth or social platforms.\n7. The Final User\nThe final user is the person who will actually use the product or service. While they may not make the purchasing decision, their satisfaction and feedback are crucial for long-term success.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nA teacher uses educational software purchased by the school administration.\nMarketing Tip:\nPrioritize user experience by gathering feedback and continuously improving products and services to meet their needs.\n8. The Gatekeeper\nThe gatekeeper controls the flow of information to other stakeholders.\nConsumer Buying Roles Example:\nA secretary screening meeting requests or an IT administrator ensuring system security.\nMarketing Tip:\nEstablish positive relationships with Gatekeepers by adhering to their standards or requirements and providing concise, relevant information. This increases the likelihood of gaining access to decision-makers or influencers.\nUnderstandin\ng all 8 consumer buying roles emp\nowers businesses to craft sales strategies that genuinely address consumer needs. By aligning strategies with these distinct roles, companies not only boost sales but also contribute to sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions.\nPartnering with a\ndigital agency\nskilled in consumer behavior analysis enables businesses to design effective marketing plans tailored to each role. This approach helps businesses build long-term value while fostering strong, lasting customer relationships for a sustainable future.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

A Shortcut to Reaching Customer\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n235\n0\nWhat is Brand Positioning and How to Create the Strategy?\n“Brand positioning”\nis the art of strategically positioning a brand to stand out in a market flooded with countless similar options. It has become a vital technique every brand must master to win customers' hearts. But how can you ensure your brand is not just another option for consumers but becomes the one and only choice they think of?\nLet’s explore the meaning, strategies, and practical steps to achieve effective brand positioning. Together, we’ll uncover how to craft\na differentiation strategy that makes your brand incomparable\n, no matter how fierce the competition!\nWhat is Brand Positioning?\nBrand positioning refe\nrs to the process of defining the image or perception that a brand wants customers to “see” or “remember.”\nThe goal is to differentiate the brand, build brand awareness, and lay the foundation for a strong relationship between the brand and its target audience.\nBut why is brand positioning important?\nE\nffective brand positioning strategy is akin to painting a clear and distinct image in the minds of consumers. This not only helps the brand s\ntand out from competitors but also fosters a deeper emotional connection with customers.\nThe Effective Brand Positioning Process\nDevelopin\ng effective brand positioning strategy is a com\nplex process requiring a deep understanding of five key dimensions. These will enable your brand to build awareness and foster meaningful connections with your target audience.\n1. Know Your Brand DNA\nAccurate brand positioning process begins with tho\nroughly understanding your brand’s essence. This foundation ensures credible and powerful communication with consumers. Key elements to define include:\nMission:\nThe organization’s core purpose beyond profitability.\nVision:\nLong-term goals and the direction the brand aspires to achieve.\nCore Values:\nPrinciples and beliefs forming the foundation of the organization.\nBrand Personality: U\nnique emotions and tones reflected in the brand’s communication.\n2. Know Your Competitors\nSystematic competitor analysis is essential to establish a uniq\nue brand positioning. By understanding competitors, you can uncover opportunities for differentiatio\nn and competitive advantage. Marketers should thoroughly assess:\nCurrent market positioning of competitors.\nStrengths and weaknesses of competitors.\nUntapped market gaps and unmet consumer needs.\n3. Know Your Customers\nUnderstanding your target audience\nis the cornerstone of the\nbrand positioning process. It enables you to design meaningful experiences and tailored communication. Customer\nanalysis should cover:\nDemographics:\nAge, income, education, occupation.\nPsychographics:\nValues, beliefs, attitudes.\nBehavioral Patterns:\nSpending habits, purchasing decisions.\nNeeds and Expectations:\nPain points, hidden desires, and aspirations.\n4. Be Unique\nDifferentiating your brand is the heart of effec\ntive brand positioning. A unique\nidentity sets your brand apart, securing a permanent place in consumers’ minds. Focus on:\nOffering unparalleled value.\nEstablishing a clear and memorable stance.\nInnovating or adopting unique approaches that competitors can’t replicate.\n5. Communicate Consistently\nConsistency in communication across all channels is key to building trust and reinforcing a clear brand image. This ensures your brand remains top-of-mind for consumers over time. Effective communication involves:\nStrategic marketing communication.\nLeveraging digital media effectively.\nEngaging with customers at every touchpoint.\nDesigning memorable and impactful customer experiences.\nHow to Create Brand Positioning That Outshines Competitors\nConduct a Comprehensive Market Analysis\nThe foundation\nof superior brand positioning strategy lies in identifying unmet customer needs that competitors have overlooked. Marketers must approach\nthis systematically, starting with an in-depth study of consumer behavior. From there, identify neglected market gaps and latent needs—those hidden desires customers might not yet articulate—and address them effectively.\nLeverage Emotional Appeal\nIn today’s marketplace, success is no longer solely determined by physical attributes of a product but also by the emotional and sensory connections a brand creates. Businesses must seamlessly align their brand with customer values or craft shared emotional experiences. Demonstrating a deep understanding of customers' profound needs fosters loyalty and resonance.\nDevelop Product Differentiation\nIf your product mirrors others in the market, even the be\nst brand positioning strategy will\nfall short. Innovation and differentiation are crucial. Identify the unique strengths of your product, create distinctive features that competitors cannot replicate, and focus on addressing specific customer pain points effectively.\nCraft Memorable Storytelling\nEngaging storytelling builds deep emotional connections with customers. Whether it’s sharing meaningful and inspiring narratives, linking brand experiences to the personal lives of customers, or creating a distinctive identity that competitors can’t imitate, compelling stories leave a lasting impression and enhance brand loyalty.\nGlobal Brands with Clear Brand Positioning Examples\nCoca-Cola\npositions itself as more than just a beverage; it’s a symbol of happiness, friendship, and togetherness. This is evident in the brand’s campaigns, which often focus on fostering shared emotions and positive experiences.\nTesla\ngoes beyond being an automobile manufacturer. The brand establishes itself as a leader in innovation aimed at transforming the world. By leveraging cutting-edge technology to address environmental issues, Tesla emphasizes its commitment to creating a sustainable future.\nApple\nexcels at\nbrand positioning b\ny emphasizing minimalist design, innovation, and seamless user experience. The brand doesn’t just sell electronic devices; it sells a lifestyle and a mindset centered on creativity and individuality.\nIn conclusi\non, brand positioning is not just a mark\neting strategy but a holistic approach that combines understanding your brand's identity, creating differentiation, and building strong connections with your audience. When executed effectively, it doesn’t just drive sales but also nurtures long-term relationships, turning customers into true brand advocates.\nAre you ready to elevate your brand to a position that commands attention?\nChoose the right path, plan strategically, and outpace your competitors. In the business world, the spotlight shines only on those who dare to stand out!\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

A Strategy of Giving Back\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n408\n0\nReciprocity Marketing: A Technique of Meaningful Giving\nReciprocity Marketing,\nor mutual exchange marketing, is not a new concept but has always been an effective strategy for building lasting relationships between brands and customers. The core principle of this technique is straightforward: it requires understanding and appropriate application. It’s not just about “giving” with the expectation of “receiving,” but about “giving” meaningfully to achieve the most valuable outcomes in return.\nWhat is Reciprocity Marketing?\nReciprocity marketing\nis a marketing strategy rooted in basic human psychology—the innate desire to reciprocate when receiving something positive.\nHowever, it goes beyond simple exchange. The concept emphasizes creating value for customers first before expecting any return.\nIf we were to compar\ne reciprocity in digital marketing or busin\ness marketing, it’s akin to building a deep personal relationship, much like giving a meaningful gift to a close friend without expecting anything in return. In the context of marketing, however, this act of giving must carry genuine significance and create true value for the customer.\nAdvantages of Reciprocity in Business Marketing\nA “Giving” Approach Beyond Traditional Marketing\nReciprocity marketing goes beyond\nmere sales promotions by\ncreating meaningful experiences\nbetween brands and customers. Here, “giving” doesn’t just refer to freebies or discounts but rather providing genuine value that truly benefits customers.\nFosters Win-Win Relationships\nThis strategy helps establish a business ecosystem where both parties benefit. Customers feel valued and appreciated, while brands earn loyalty in return—a mutually rewarding relationship.\nTurns Customers into Brand Advocates\nWhen customers feel uniquely cared for, they’re more likely to become passionate advocates for the brand. They might also spread the word to those around them (Word of Mouth) and effectively boost brand awareness.\nInfuses the Brand’s DNA with Authenticity\nReciprocity marketing reflects sincerity an\nd organizational values, demonstrating that the brand prioritizes building long-term relationships with customers rather than just focusing on sales.\nTechniques for Successful Reciprocity Marketing\nProvide Value Before Expecting Returns\nThe essence of reciprocity in digital marketing lies in delivering meanin\ngful value to customers, beyond simply offering freebies. This value can take various forms, such as:\nCreating guides, infographics, or skill-based instructional videos free of charge.\nBuilding a knowledge repository accessible to customers at no cost.\nOffering free consultations or advice without any obligations.\nDeveloping applications or online tools that solve customer problems.\nTailor Offerings to Different Customer Groups\nUnderstanding that customer needs vary is key to creating personalized and impactful experiences. Marketers can achieve this by:\nUsing analytical tools to study customer behavior and preferences.\nSegmenting customers and crafting experiences tailored to each group.\nListening to customer feedback and making continuous improvements.\nDesigning offers or promotions that align with individual interests.\nFocus on Creating Memorable Experiences\nSmall, thoughtful details often leave lasting impr\nessions. Reciprocity marketing empha\nsizes understanding and addressing customers' deeper needs, exceeding their expectations through gestures like:\nSolving issues proactively before customers raise them.\nBuilding emotional connections, such as fostering online communities for support and shared experiences.\nEnsuring consistency across all touchpoints, maintaining the same service standards in every branch.\nProviding post-purchase care, such as follow-ups and showing genuine concern.\nEmploy the Surprise and Delight Strategy\nThis approach involves creating unexpected positive experiences for customers, making them feel special and valued. Examples include:\nGiving surprise gifts to customers on random occasions, without waiting for events like birthdays or minimum purchase thresholds.\nOffering upgrades or added value to products or services at no extra cost.\nCelebrating customers’ milestones, such as congratulating them on achievements.\nDelivering exclusive experiences, such as hosting events or offering unique privileges.\nCommunicate Intent Clearly\nHonest and transparent communication builds trust with customers. People can sense authenticity, so brands must focus on genuine interactions by:\n﻿\nDemonstrating transparency, such as openly sharing information.\nEncouraging two-way communication by inviting customer feedback.\nSharing the brand’s story to communicate values and goals effectively.\nPrioritizing quick and efficient responses in communication.\nReciprocity in business marketing isn’t just about driving sales; it’s about building a brand that customers trust and are eager to support in the l\nong run. By becoming a “giver” of meaningful value that enriches your customers’ lives, your brand stands out in a competitive market. Ultimately, giving isn’t merely a strategy—it’s the essence of true marketing.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

This leads to wasted time on non-essential tasks and missed opportunities for innovation. Effective time management is a crucial skill that allows professionals to focus on high-value tasks and achieve the best possible outcomes.\nDiscover 6 proven time management techniques that can help increase work efficiency. If you're ready to transform your work habits and enhance productivity, let's get started!\n6 Time Management Techniques to Increase Work Efficiency\n1. Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritizing Tasks Effectively\nThe Eisenhower Matrix is a time management technique developed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former President of the United States. This method helps professionals and business leaders categorize tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing them to manage multiple responsibilities effectively.\nTasks are divided into 4 categories:\nImportant and Urgent (Q1):\nCritical tasks that require immediate attention, such as emergencies or approaching deadlines.\nImportant but Not Urgent (Q2):\nStrategic planning, long-term projects, and personal development.\nNot Important but Urgent (Q3):\nMeetings, requests from others, and tasks that can be delegated.\nNot Important and Not Urgent (Q4):\nTime-wasting activities like excessive social media use without purpose.\nTo maximize efficiency with the Eisenhower Matrix, focus primarily on Q2 tasks, as they provide long-term value and reduce future urgent crises (Q1). Delegate Q3 tasks whenever possible and minimize or eliminate Q4 tasks.\n2. The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle): Focus on High-Impact Tasks\nThe Pareto Principle, or 80/20 rule, states that 80% of results come from just 20% of efforts. When applied to time management, this means that a small portion of tasks contribute to the majority of success.\nTo apply the Pareto Principle effectively:\nAnalyze all tasks and identify which ones yield the highest impact.\nPrioritize and allocate time to the most impactful tasks.\nReduce or eliminate low-value tasks that consume time without significant returns.\n3. The 1-3-5 Method: Structuring Daily Priorities\nThe 1-3-5 Method is a simple yet one of highly effective time management techniques that helps professionals balance their workload and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This method ensures a sense of accomplishment while maintaining realistic daily goals.\nEach day, focus on:\n1 major task –\nA high-priority task that requires significant time and effort.\n3 medium tasks –\nImportant tasks that need attention but are not as demanding.\n5 small tasks –\nQuick, necessary tasks that can be completed efficiently.\nBusiness leaders can adapt this approach by planning their workload in advance at the beginning of each week for better clarity and focus.\n4. Eat Your Frog: Tackling the Toughest Task First\nThe \"Eat Your Frog\" method, inspired by Brian Tracy’s book and Mark Twain’s famous quote, encourages professionals to complete their most challenging task first thing in the morning. The rationale is that once the hardest task is done, the rest of the day will feel much easier.\nYour \"frog\" refers to tasks that are:\nThe most difficult\nThe most tedious\nThe most important\nOften procrastinated\nThis technique is particularly useful for entrepreneurs handling high-stakes negotiations, critical decision-making, or complex problem-solving.\n5. Deep Work: Maximizing Productivity with Focused Work Sessions\nCal Newport’s Deep Work concept emphasizes the importance of focused, distraction-free work to enhance productivity and creativity. This method is ideal for strategic planning, innovation, and problem-solving.\nTo implement Deep Work:\nSet dedicated time blocks (at least 1-2 hours) for deep work.\nEliminate distractions by turning off notifications, phones, and emails.\nChoose a suitable work environment that fosters concentration.\nDefine clear goals for each deep work session.\nResearch by Gerald Weinberg shows that multitasking can reduce work efficiency by up to 80%. Establishing \"no-interruption zones\" in your workplace can significantly boost productivity.\n6. The Pomodoro Technique: Working in Time Blocks\nDeveloped by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique is one of the time management skills that enhances focus and reduces mental fatigue by breaking work into short, structured intervals.\nHow to increase work efficiency by the Pomodoro Technique:\nSet a 25-minute timer and work intensely without distractions.\nTake a 5-minute break after each Pomodoro session.\nThis technique fosters a sense of urgency, improving focus and efficiency while preventing burnout.\nEffective time management skills are a key driver of productivity and success. These 6 techniques offer flexible strategies to help you work smarter, whether managing personal projects or leading a team. The key is to select the method that aligns best with your work style and responsibilities. By refining your approach to time management, you can reduce stress, enhance efficiency, and unlock greater opportunities for success.\nHowever, if you find time management challenging or need a more structured system, a\nbusiness consulting company\ncan provide customized strategies to optimize time management for your organization. Investing in the right approach today can lead to a more productive and fulfilling work life.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

The more an event can impress attendees to the point where they feel like they “don’t want to leave,” the clearer the signal that the brand has delivered a quality experience.\nThis kind of success doesn’t happen by chance. It’s the result of intentional planning, design, and meticulous attention to every detail of the event experience—anchored in what’s known as a\nsensory experience\n. Here’s how leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates who keep coming back for more.\nWhat Is a Sensory Experience?\nA sensory experience refers to a marketing approach that engages the human senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions.\nBy appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments that foster deep emotional engagement and personal connection.\nBrands that master the art of crafting sensory experiences don’t just make an impression—they embed themselves in memory. It’s not just about awareness; it’s about emotion and attachment. This depth of connection is what fuels long-term brand loyalty and drives organic word of mouth.\n7 Sensory Experience Techniques for Designing Unforgettable Event Experiences\n1. Stimulate Sight\n\"Attract from the first glance with a design that reflects your brand identity.\"\nVisual presentation is the gateway to your brand’s universe. Elements like spatial design, lighting, brand colors, logos, and stage visuals should clearly reflect the brand image. Using brand-consistent color palettes, lighting that complements the mood, and Instagram-worthy photo spots can organically boost online sharing and visibility.\n2. Engage Taste\n\"A great taste lingers longer than any words.\"\nFood and beverages aren’t just refreshments—they’re storytelling tools. Curate menus that align with your event’s theme, incorporate local flavors to set the scene, or even develop signature drinks and treats that reflect your brand identity. Each bite becomes an extension of your brand narrative.\n3. Evoke Memory Through Smell\n\"Scent is the most powerful trigger of memory.\"\nScents have a surprising influence on mood and memory. Pleasant aromas throughout your event space can induce calmness, luxury, or energy. Align your fragrance strategy with the event theme—for example, lavender for wellness events or citrus scents for energizing environments.\n4. Enliven the Atmosphere with Sound\n\"The right sound sets the right mood.\"\nFrom playlists to ambient noise to human chatter, sound shapes the entire event experience. Choose music that fits the theme, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound design for product reveals. Every sound element should contribute to the overall sensory experience.\n5. Activate Touch\n\"Tactile experiences create lasting impressions.\"\nTouch adds a tangible dimension to your brand. Use textured materials in decor, offer hands-on product demos, or provide custom-designed giveaways. DIY or workshop zones are also effective, encouraging attendees to engage physically and emotionally with your brand.\n6. Tap into Emotion\n\"When the heart feels, the brand stays.\"\nEmotional engagement transforms experiences. Encourage attendees to share personal stories, use uplifting or inspiring content, or tell your brand’s story through short films. Emotionally charged moments—pride, joy, inspiration—convert passive guests into brand advocates.\n7. Add Meaning Through Spirit\n\"Brands with purpose make a deeper impact.\"\nTrue impact comes when experiences reflect the brand’s deeper values and mission. Include social impact initiatives, tie into environmental or cultural causes, or create space for guests to share dreams and beliefs. Let every moment mean more than just “fun”—make it meaningful.\nCase Study: Brands That Successfully Used Sensory Experience to Win Over Audiences\nIncorporating the sensory experience model in event planning doesn’t just create fleeting impressions. It can shift consumer behavior, boost conversions, and build lasting brand recognition. Here are two success stories that prove its effectiveness:\nTraveloka: Engaging Travelers with Limited Space\nAs the travel industry began recovering post-COVID-19, regional platform Traveloka sought to reignite interest among travelers. With just a 30-square-meter booth in a high-traffic Bangkok mall, they partnered with Jenosize to run an activation campaign. Activities included mini-games, discount giveaways, and celebrity photo ops—maximizing impact within tight spatial constraints.\nResults:\nOver 200 attendees per day during the 3-day event\nSignificant lift in brand recall and online deal redemptions\nMRT Purple Line: Redefining Public Perception\nDuring the launch of Bangkok’s MRT Purple Line, the brand aimed to create a positive image despite fare concerns. Using both online and offline event strategies focused on sensory experiences, they successfully shifted customer perception.\nResults:\nRebranded as “A New Year’s Gift” for commuters\n70% increase in ridership during the campaign\nPassengers began recognizing the long-term value and quality of the service\nIn a world where brands compete through experience rather than advertising, creating events that make attendees “never want to leave” becomes a competitive advantage. These seven techniques go beyond aesthetics—they foster emotional connection and long-term brand loyalty.\nIf your business is looking for an\nevent management company\nthat understands experiential strategy and knows how to truly engage your audience,\nJenosize\nis your ideal partner.

Public safety innovation remains one of trending startup businesses with high growth potential.\n3. Stablecoins 2.0\nStablecoins are entering a new era of widespread adoption.\nAccording to Y Combinator\n, stablecoin transaction volumes now account for 20% of Mastercard's, with nearly 30% of cross-border transfers utilizing this technology. Leading financial institutions like Visa are developing platforms for banks to issue their own stablecoins. Stripe’s $1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge highlights investor enthusiasm, making stablecoin technology a clear candidate for\nthe list of startups to watch in 2025. Op\nportunities in this space include platforms for businesses to manage stablecoins and tools for developers to integrate stablecoins into their systems seamlessly.\n4. LLMs for Chip Design\nThe rise of AI has driven demand for highly efficient chips, positioning chip design as a national priority in many countries. AI-powered solutions, such as OpenAI O1, have shown the potential to revolutionize science and engineering, particularly in designing ASICs and FPGAs.

In today’s world where customers have endless choices, success isn’t about who sells first — it’s about who can make customers come back again and again.\nSelling on marketplaces may help you gain new customers today, but if they don’t return tomorrow, your business ends up starting from scratch every day. The real question is: wouldn’t it be better to have a system where every click, every order, and every referral contributes to long-term customer relationships — automatically?\nWhy Relying Solely on Marketplaces Could Be Holding Back Your Brand Building Success\nCommission Fees Up to 20–30%\nOne of the biggest hidden costs of marketplace selling is the high commission and platform fees. Some platforms take as much as 30% of your total sales revenue. This significantly reduces your profit per item, leaving less to invest in product development or future branding strategies.\nNo Access to Customer Data\nA major limitation of selling on marketplaces is that you don’t get direct access to customer data like emails, phone numbers, or purchasing behavior. Yet, this information is essential in the brand building process, helping you tailor communication, launch personalized campaigns, and improve customer retention.\nLimited Ability to Build Long-Term Customer Relationships\nMarketplace sales don’t align with core branding principles, as you’re essentially “renting space” on someone else’s platform. This prevents your brand from forming emotional bonds with customers or delivering the kind of personalized experience that fosters loyalty.\nEasy for Customers to Switch to Competitors\nWithout a unique brand experience or value proposition, marketplace customers often compare solely on price. If a competitor offers a lower price, they’ll easily win the sale. This is a critical risk for brands that haven’t yet built strong identity or differentiation.\nWhat Is a Loyalty Program — and Why Do Modern Businesses Need One?\nIn today’s competitive branding landscape, creating deep customer connections is key. One of the most effective tools in the brand building process is a loyalty program — a reward system offering points, perks, and exclusive benefits to repeat customers.\nReduce Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)\nAcquiring a new customer costs up to five times more than retaining an existing one. Investing in a Loyalty Program helps encourage repeat purchases, significantly lowering your overall acquisition costs.\nIncrease Average Order Value (AOV)\nWhen customers feel that “the more they buy, the more they benefit,” they naturally tend to spend more. Well-designed point systems and member-only promotions incentivize larger purchases — without feeling like a hard sell.\nBoost Repeat Purchases\nThe ultimate goal of brand building is creating a loyal customer base. A Loyalty Program keeps your brand top-of-mind, driving repeat purchases through rewards that offer both emotional and tangible value.\nEnhance Word-of-Mouth Marketing\nHappy customers who feel valued by your brand often become advocates — sharing their experience with friends and family. This type of word-of-mouth marketing is more trustworthy than traditional ads and helps expand your customer base at a lower cost.\nEverydayCustomer: The Modern Business Solution for Brand Building\nIn an age where marketplaces charge 20–30% commissions and limit access to customer data, building your own platform is one of smart and sustainable branding principles.\nEverydayCustomer is an all-in-one platform built to help Thai SMEs shift away from marketplace dependency and toward managing their own branded storefront\n— consolidating all essential business tools in one place:\nUX-first Website Builder:\nCreate a seamless online storefront with inventory, coupon, and order management — no coding required.\nTiered & Subscription-Based Loyalty System:\nEncourage repeat purchases and increase brand loyalty through customizable membership benefits and reward tiers.\nLINE, Facebook, IG, and TikTok Integration:\nCombine all your social channels into one platform, enabling seamless omnichannel commerce experiences.\nReferral Program:\nLet customers refer friends via QR codes or custom links and reward them with exclusive discounts or gifts.\nAI-Generated SEO Content:\nSave time on content creation with AI that automatically writes SEO-friendly product descriptions, promotions, and blog posts.\nOne-Page Checkout:\nSimplify the buying process and increase conversion rates with a fast, user-friendly checkout experience that supports QR payments and credit cards.\nOnline–Offline Customer Data Sync:\nCapture customer data both in-store and online, allowing for precise marketing plans and data-driven brand building decisions.\nIn today’s world, sales aren’t just numbers on a dashboard — they’re the starting point for meaningful, long-term relationships. Businesses that truly grow aren’t just good at selling — they’re good at understanding their customers and making them want to come back.\nSustainable branding doesn’t come from chasing new customers every day, but from delivering great experiences to the ones you already have. That’s where smart loyalty systems, engaging reward programs, and valuable referrals come into play.\nEverydayCustomer is designed to be more than just a website builder — it’s a\ntech solution for businesses\nto build long-term profitability.\nIt’s time to build sales that don’t disappear into thin air — and customer loyalty that lasts beyond the first purchase.

One of the powerful digital technologies emerging this year is \"\nSpatial Computing\n\" and \"\nImmersive Technology\n,\" some of which are already being utilized by brands to create new opportunities. Whether it's creating captivating shopping experiences or offering personalized products and services, these technologies are leaving a lasting impression on customers, ultimately leading to increased revenue and long-term brand loyalty.\nLet's delve deeper into both of these technologies and understand how incorporating these innovations can make retail businesses more efficient, contemporary, and stand out from the competition.\nWhat is Spatial Computing?\nSpatial Computing is the processing of spatial data\n, a technology that merges the virtual world with the real world by creating digital environments and objects. In this digital format, everything in the real world, whether it's users, objects, or environments, can interact seamlessly with digital counterparts.\nWhat is Immersive Technology?\nImmersive Technology simulates a comprehensive\n, lifelike experience by drawing users into a virtual environment, created through a combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. This immersive experience encompasses visuals, sounds, and various sensory perceptions. A common example is VR headsets that transport wearers into entirely different environments, distinct from their physical surroundings, providing a fully immersive experience. A recent example is the Apple Vision Pro glasses, which represent Apple's first foray into spatial computing glasses, offering users an advanced immersive experience.\nImplementing Spatial Computing & Immersive Technology in Retail Stores\nRetail businesses can leverage Spatial Computing & Immersive Technology in various ways. Some common examples of their usage include:\nAllowing Customers to Virtually Try Products\nRetailers of clothing, shoes, jewelry, or cosmetics can utilize these innovations to enable customers to virtually try products before making a purchase decision. For instance, customers can try on clothes virtually without having to remove their current attire, or experiment with makeup looks without using actual cosmetics. This can be achieved through Computer Vision systems, leveraging techniques like machine learning and deep learning to track positions and movements, detect faces, and differentiate objects, coupled with AR technology.\nIn-Store Navigation\nFor larger retail outlets with a vast array of products, AR technology can be employed to create a 3D map of the store, allowing customers to easily and quickly locate items. Additionally, 3D scanning technology can be utilized to create a three-dimensional model of the interior space, including the positioning of products and various fixtures. This information can then be stored as digital data on a cloud-based system.\nAutomatic Payment Processing\nCustomers can make payments automatically without relying on cashiers, a feature already observed in retail businesses in China and the United States. This technology enhances convenience and reduces waiting times for customers. Key technologies utilized include facial recognition and identity verification systems, seamlessly linking to user accounts and payment information for swift transaction processing.\nDistant Shopping Experience\nBusinesses can utilize VR technology to offer customers a virtual shopping experience without the need to physically visit the store. This goes beyond traditional online shopping, as it immerses customers in a virtual representation of the store, even while they're at home placing orders. It's another avenue to create a memorable experience for customers, making them feel as if they're truly inside the store, even when they're just browsing from the comfort of their homes.\nThe Benefits of Utilizing Spatial Computing and Immersive Tech in Retail Stores\nCreating Memorable Customer Experiences\nThese technologies add a new dimension to the shopping experience for customers by allowing them to see, hear, and feel products virtually before making a purchase decision. When customers have a positive experience, it fosters a stronger connection with the business, ultimately leading to increased loyalty in the long run.\nEnhancing Sales Efficiency\nRetailers can present products in more detailed and engaging ways, reducing limitations in space and time for selling products and services. Additionally, they can provide more personalized recommendations tailored to customer needs, encouraging customers to return for repeat purchases.\nFacilitating Accurate Data Analysis\nAI technology enables business owners to gather detailed and comprehensive data on customer purchasing behaviors by tracking user interactions with the digital products we create. This information can then be analyzed to develop marketing strategies that are even more effective in the future.\nIncreasing Cross-Selling Opportunities\nFor instance, a customer may initially intend to buy a specific shirt, but when they try it on through virtual reality, the system may suggest a skirt that complements the shirt perfectly. If the customer likes how the outfit looks when they try it on, there's a greater chance of selling both items than just the initially intended purchase. This not only simplifies product recommendations but also boosts sales simultaneously.\nAdopting spatial computing and immersive tech intelligently can elevate experiences for both businesses and customers. Customers can engage with products and shop in novel ways, leading to informed purchase decisions and long-term brand loyalty. Simultaneously, businesses can modernize their image, becoming memorable leaders in future innovation. However, it's crucial to prioritize customer privacy, obtaining consent for data collection and usage transparently to build trust.\nTo accelerate your business's success in the virtual world, our\nBrandverse\nservice can guide your business into the era of marketing 5.0 comprehensively and efficiently.

However, there is a fascinating\nmarketing\nphenomenon that explains the opposite of what should be happening. This is known as the\n\"lipstick effect\"\ntheory, which describes the tendency of consumers to continue purchasing small luxury items even during poor economic conditions.\nWhat is the Lipstick Effect?\nThe lipstick effect is an economic theory that explains consumer behavior during economic downturns. It observes that consumers, especially women, tend to continue buying affordable luxury items such as lipstick, cosmetics, accessories, etc., even when they have to economize in other areas. This phenomenon demonstrates that even during tough economic times, people still desire small pleasures and positive feelings from purchasing items that make them feel better about themselves.\nThe History of the Lipstick Effect\nThe concept of the lipstick effect was first introduced by Leonard Lauder, the chairman of Estée Lauder Companies, in 2001. He observed that the company's lipstick sales increased significantly after the 9/11 events, a period when the U.S. economy was facing difficulties. Subsequently, this concept gained widespread attention and was subjected to in-depth studies by economists and marketers worldwide.\nHowever, a similar phenomenon had been observed even earlier. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, lipstick sales also increased surprisingly. This demonstrates that the phenomenon is rooted in deep-seated human behavior and has recurred throughout history.\nReasons Behind the Lipstick Effect\nNeed for Confidence\nDuring times of economic uncertainty, people often feel insecure and seek ways to boost their confidence. The solution lies in purchasing affordable cosmetics or beauty products, as these can help elevate self-worth and increase confidence without spending as much as on larger luxury items.\nChanging Spending Patterns\nWhen the economy is poor, consumers tend to reduce spending on large, expensive items such as houses or cars. As a result, they turn to small luxuries for happiness, as these provide a sense of fulfillment without requiring significant expenditure.\nIncreased Emotional Value\nDuring difficult times, small items like lipstick or perfume may have a greater emotional impact. They help consumers feel better when facing stress from economic uncertainty. Purchasing these items is like giving oneself a reward at an affordable price.\nSocial Mimicry\nEven in tough economic times, people still want to maintain their social image. Therefore, buying affordable beauty or fashion items allows them to feel part of social trends and fashion without overspending.\nThe Impact of the Lipstick Effect on Economy and Business\nBusiness Adaptation\nCompanies, especially in the beauty and fashion industries, often adjust their marketing strategies to respond to the lipstick effect. They may focus on producing smaller or more affordable items to attract consumers seeking small pleasures during economic downturns.\nBusiness Risk Diversification\nCompanies with diverse product lines may leverage the lipstick effect by emphasizing the marketing of more affordable products to compensate for declining sales of expensive items.\nCreation of New Business Opportunities\nThe lipstick effect may lead to the emergence of new businesses that focus on producing small luxury items or affordable luxuries to meet consumer demands during economic recessions.\nMaintaining Economic Stability\nAlthough small in scale, the lipstick effect can help maintain money circulation in the economic system, potentially alleviating some impacts of economic recession.\nLong-term Changes in Consumer Behavior\nThe lipstick effect may result in long-term changes in consumer behavior, with consumers tending to place more importance on the value and cost-effectiveness of products, even after the economy recovers.\nExamples of the Lipstick Effect in Thailand\nDuring periods of economic difficulty in Thailand\n, such as after the Tom Yum Kung crisis in 1997 or during the economic slowdown from 2017-2019, it was observed that female consumers showed increased interest in beauty products. According to a 2017 report by Kasikorn Research Center, the value of the cosmetics market in Thailand continued to grow by 6.5%, amounting to 168 billion baht. The facial product group, including lipsticks, had a high growth rate of 8%.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand\n, which severely impacted the economy, many consumers chose to invest in skincare products for face and body, even while being more cautious about spending in other areas. Data from Euromonitor International reported that in 2020, the skincare product market in Thailand was valued at 47,700 million baht, growing 1.8% from the previous year, despite the overall economy contracting by 6.1%.\nThe lipstick effect is considered an interesting and important phenomenon in economics and marketing. Although it occurs during economic downturns, it demonstrates that consumers still desire small luxury items that can make them feel better. Understanding this phenomenon helps businesses adjust their marketing strategies and operations to align with consumer behavior in uncertain economic conditions. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of happiness and confidence in consumers' lives, which should not be overlooked even during economic recessions.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nOligopoly Market: Is Selling Easier with Fewer Competitors?\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n867\n0\nOligopoly Market: Fewer Competitors Doesn't Mean It's Easier\nIn the past, monopoly markets dominated the busines\ns world. However, with stricter antitrust laws, large businesses began to break apart, giving rise to the oligopoly market—where o\nnly a few sellers dominate.\nMany people might think that having only a few competitors means more\nbusiness opportunities\n, but in reality, the opposite is true! When the market is divided among just a few major players, competition intensifies significantly, with enormous budgets, complex strategies, and endless investments in innovation.\nLet’s first understand: What is an Oligopoly Market?\nAn oligopoly market, or a ma\nrket with few sellers, is a market structure dominated by only a small number of large companies.\nTypically, there are at least two players but no more than ten. Each company holds a significant market share, so the decisions and business strategies of each player have a considerable impact on the overall market.\nAnother key characteristic of\nan oligopoly market is that each company often has some power to set prices and control production levels. However, they cannot make these decisions entirely on their own, as they must consider potential reactions from other competitors. Additionally, entering an oligopoly market in Thailand\ncan be challenging due to several obstacles, including high capital investment requirements, the need for specialized technology or expertise, and regulatory constraints or licensing requirements.\nInteresting Examples of Oligopoly Markets in Thailand and the Challenges Each Industry Faces\nIn Thailand, there are several industries with an oligopoly market structure, where only a few major players dominate the market. Each of these industries fa\nces unique challenges and competition. Here are some examples of oligopoly markets:\nThai Beer Market\nThe Thai beer market is a clear example of an oligopoly, with only a few key players, led by Boon Rawd Brewery (Singha) and Thai Beverage (Chang), which together control over 90% of the market share. A major challenge in this industry is the strict legal regulations, including advertising restrictions, production permits, and distribution laws, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to break into the market.\nAirline Industry\nThe airline market in Thailand is also oligopolistic, with a few major players like Thai Airways, Thai AirAsia, Nok Air, and Thai Lion Air competing intensely. The challenges they face include high operating costs, such as fuel prices, aircraft maintenance, and fleet investments. Additionally, external factors like the COVID-19 crisis have had a severe impact on the aviation industry.\nE-Commerce Platforms\nAlthough relatively new, the e-commerce market in Thailand also shows oligopoly characteristics. Major players like Shopee, Lazada, and JD Central dominate the competition. The main challenges in this industry include massive investments in logistics infrastructure, high marketing costs, building consumer trust, and retaining customers in the face of fierce competition.\nMobile Telecommunications Market\nThe telecommunications market in Thailand is controlled by three major providers: AIS, DTAC, and TRUE. Each of these companies must invest heavily in infrastructure, including signal towers, frequency auctions, and the development of 5G technology. Major challenges include intense price competition, maintaining service quality, and generating additional revenue from digital services.\nFood Delivery Apps\nThe food delivery app market in Thailand is dominated by Grab, foodpanda, and LINE MAN, which compete fiercely with each other. The challenges in this industry involve balancing revenue and costs, maintaining service quality, managing riders, and competing with high-cost promotions. Moreover, continuous technological development is necessary to enhance service efficiency.\nWhy Do Businesses in an Oligopoly Market Have to Invest More Than Expected?\nMany people might think that doing business in an oligopoly market (with few sellers) is easier than in a competitive market. However, the reality is quite the opposite. The oligopoly market comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore why this is the case:\nHigh Barriers to Entry\nThe reason there are only a few sellers in a\nn oligopoly market is not th\nat no one wants to enter, but because there are many obstacles to entry. Some of these include:\nMassive Initial Investment:\nFor example, in the telecommunications business, companies need to invest in networks, signal towers, and frequency auctions, which can cost billions of baht.\nContinuous Investment in Technology and Innovation:\nBusinesses must constantly invest in technology development, such as the 5G rollout in telecommunications or platform development in e-commerce.\nRegulatory Requirements:\nCompanies must secure licenses, pass standard inspections, and comply with strict regulations. This process involves both time and money.\nIntense Competition\nAlthough there are few players in the market, the competition\nin an oligopoly market is o\nften fiercer than in typical markets because:\nIntense Marketing Competition:\nBusinesses must allocate enormous budgets for advertising and promotions. For example, food delivery platforms continuously offer discounts and promotions to stay competitive.\nConstant Product and Service Development:\nCompanies must always invest in developing new products and services to maintain a competitive edge.\nMarket Share Maintenance:\nAs market share increases, companies must invest more resources to retain their customer base.\nHigher Consumer Expectations Than in Competitive Markets\nBeing a major player in the market means dealing with higher consumer expectations, including:\nService Standards:\nConsumers expect premium services, such as in the airline industry, where safety and high-level customer service standards must be maintained at all times.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\nCompanies need to invest in CSR activities and build a positive corporate image.\nCrisis Management:\nWhen issues arise, consumers expect quick and effective resolutions, such as when a bank's system crashes or mobile signals are disrupted.\nBeing a player in an oligopoly market may s\neem advantageous due to having fewer competitors, but in reality, such markets come with both pros and cons. Companies must invest more resources and effort than many might think to maintain their leadership and meet the ever-increasing consumer expectations.\nSo, the answer to the question, \"Is it easier to sell when there are fewer competitors?\" is clearly \"No.\" The true challenge does not lie in the number of competitors, but in the scale of investment required and the high expectations of the market.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

So, integrating online and offline marketing channels, known as O2O (Online to Offline) Marketing, is something not to be overlooked. By focusing on providing excellent\ncustomer experiences (CX)\n, businesses can stand out from competitors, even if they operate within the same industry.\nWhat is Customer Experience (CX)?\nCustomer Experience (CX) is the entirety of experiences that customers receive from interacting with a brand, product, or service,\nstarting from before the purchase, during the purchase, and after the purchase. CX encompasses every touchpoint between the customer and the brand, whether it's advertising, sales, customer service, product usage, or even communication through various online and offline media.\nIn this regard, the key components of customer experience are creating experiences that are impressive, convenient, and valuable to customers in order to foster brand loyalty and stimulate repeat purchases in the future. So, creating CX is considered a crucial key to competing in the era of Marketing 5.0.\nWhy is it Important to Create a Blended CX Between Online and Offline channels?\nCurrently, consumer behavior has shifted towards more diverse channels for brand interaction and purchasing, whether it be online or offline. Therefore, creating a blended customer experience across these two channels is crucial for the following reasons:\nMeeting the needs of modern consumers\nwho lead a blended lifestyle between the online and offline worlds, resulting in smoother and more convenient purchasing experiences for products or services.\nFostering strong relationships with customers\nas brands can consistently engage with customers both online and offline, leading to tighter bonds with customers.\nEnhancing sales and marketing efficiency\nby leveraging data from various channels to analyze and improve strategies to better meet customer needs.\nSetting oneself apart and standing out from competitors\nby offering seamless and comprehensive experiences across all channels, while other competitors may prioritize only one channel.\nIncreasing profit opportunities and building customer loyalty\nas customers who have positive experiences both online and offline are more likely to be impressed, leading to repeat purchases and word-of-mouth recommendations to others.\n5 Techniques for Integrating Online and Offline Customer Experience\nKnow Your Customers\nGathering Demographic Data, Lifestyle Patterns, Purchasing Behaviors, and Preferences of Target Audiences from Both Online and Offline Channels\nAnalyze the collected data to gain deep understanding of customers, including their needs, current challenges, strengths, weaknesses, etc.\nUtilize the information to strategize marketing efforts and create experiences that best resonate with customers.\nDeliver a Seamless Cross-Channel Experience\nMerge online and in-store purchasing channels smoothly, including product information, post-sale services, payment processes, etc.\nProvide convenience for customers to initiate purchases from one channel and seamlessly transition to another. For example, customers can browse products online, reserve them, then pay in-store, or they can try products in-store and later order them online.\nIntegrate customer databases between the two channels so that sales staff can access customer purchase history anywhere.\nHarnessing Technology Benefits\nUtilize AI to analyze customer data such as preferences, purchase history, and provide tailored product recommendations accurately.\nLeverage the\nMetaverse\nand AR/VR to create exciting shopping experiences, making it feel like customers are physically in the store while browsing through their mobile screens.\nAllow customers to try on clothes or view products through AR/VR both online and in-store.\nOrganize special events\non the Metaverse for customers to participate in new and innovative formats.\nEmphasizing Personalized Marketing\nUtilize data from all platforms to deeply understand each customer, then tailor content, promotions, and experiences to match individual preferences and needs.\nSend email notifications or special offers before appointments or after purchases to foster customer engagement.\nTrain staff to provide personalized care for customers both online and offline.\nSelling offline and Building Online Relationships\nEncourage customers who visit the store to engage with the brand online, such as signing up for newsletters or receiving special promotions via email or SMS.\nCreate marketing campaigns targeting customers who have visited the store before to maintain customer loyalty and stimulate repeat purchases.\nUtilize online channels to gather feedback on satisfaction after in-store purchases, then use this feedback to improve and develop the store further.\nCase Study\nCurrently, many businesses are increasingly adopting O2O marketing strategies to meet the needs of modern consumers, and a significant number of them have achieved success by creating seamless customer experiences between online and offline channels.

But today, all these things have become so normal that we've almost forgotten how life was before technology changed it all.\nSo, what about the future from here? What\nnew innovations\nwill shape our world? This article will take you on a journey through the\n\"10\nMegatrend\ns of\n2025\"\nset to shake up the world in the coming year. These aren’t just speculations; they are emerging trends that have already shown clear signs of becoming the driving force for massive change!\n﻿\n10 Megatrends of 2025 That Will Open New Horizons in the 6.0 Era\n1. Generative AI as Both a Golden Opportunity and Risk for Business\nGenerative\nAI\nis rapidly revolutionizing technology and business sectors and will become one of the most signi\nficant megatrends in 2025. This innovati\non will bring both opportunities and challenges to organizations. On one hand, it can enhance efficiency, spark new ideas, and create unprecedented business opportunities, such as high-quality content creation in record time, big data analysis for insights, and the development of products and services that better meet customer needs. However, it also presents risks, including data security concerns, copyright issues, and potential impacts on the labor market. Businesses must develop strategies to leverage Generative AI ethically and responsibly, preparing for possible shifts in workforce dynamics.\n2. Climate Action as an Urgent Mission, Driving Businesses Toward Sustainability\nClimate change has intensified, making it an urgent mission for all sectors, especially businesses, to adopt more\nsustainable models\n. This shift is not only a social responsibility but also a business opportunity. Companies need to invest in clean technology, develop eco-friendly products, improve production efficiency, and set clear greenhouse gas reduction targets, all of which are becoming standard for businesses of all sizes.\n3. Rising Inflation: Impact on Costs, Consumer Spending Power, and Monetary Policy\nAnother megatrend for 2025 is i\nnflation, which is expected to have wide-reaching impacts on the economy, increasing production costs, reducing consumer purchasing power, and influencing central bank policies. To cope, businesses will need to refine cost management strategies, create flexible supply chains, and develop products that meet consumer needs in times of decreased purchasing power. Staying informed on\neconomic\nand financial policies is crucial for long-term business planning.\n4. Demographic Shifts: Preparing for a Multi-Generational Society\nDemographic changes are leading to a new\nmegatrend—a mo\nre age-diverse society. While some countries are becoming aging societies, others still have large youth populations. These shifts will significantly impact the labor market, social welfare, and consumption patterns. Businesses should develop products and services that cater to all age groups, create inclusive workplaces for multiple generations, and innovate in health and eldercare technologies, tapping into important business opportunities.\n5. Rapid Technological Advancements\nTechnologies like AI, IoT, 5G, Quantum Computing, and Biotechnology are transforming all areas of society and the economy, creating new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and solutions to global challenges. Organizations need to closely monitor\ntech advancements\n, invest in relevant technologies, and build digital skills within their teams while fostering a culture of innovation.\n6. Shift in Global Economic Power with Greater Roles for Asian Countries\nAsian countries, particularly China and India, are playing increasingly influential roles on the global economic stage, impacting trade, investment, and consumption patterns worldwide. Businesses must adapt their strategies to leverage opportunities and address challenges from\nthis megatrend. Und\nerstanding the culture, consumer behavior, and legal frameworks in Asian markets can increase chances of success. Building partnerships with regional companies is also a key strategy for expanding markets and accessing new innovations.\n7. Rapid Urbanization: Economic Opportunities and Innovation, but with Challenges\nMajor cities are becoming hubs for innovation, job creation, and economic growth, yet they also face resource management, pollution, and social inequality challenges. Businesses should adapt to meet urban consumer needs by developing smart city solutions and supporting sustainable urban initiatives, including investments in sustainable infrastructure, clean technology, and efficient public transportation systems.\n8. Hybrid Work as the New Norm\nHybrid work, combining remote and in-office work, will become a global megatrend in the\nfuture of work, enhancing flexibility and productivity for employees. Consequently, organizations must develop remote work-friendly technological infrastructure, foster a culture that supports hybrid work, and strengthen distributed team management skills. This will help attract and retain talented employees over the long term.\n9. Transition from Fossil Fuels to Clean and Renewable Energy: A Key Step Towards a Sustainable Future\nInvestment in solar, wind, hydrogen energy, and energy storage technologies will significantly increase, along with stricter policies on greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses must adapt by investing in clean energy technologies, improving energy efficiency, and creating eco-friendly products and services. This transition also presents new business opportunities in the production and distribution of clean energy, the development of energy infrastructure, and energy management services.\n10. Revolutionizing Transportation with Electric Vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles, and Shared Mobility\nThe development of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility concepts will greatly impact the automotive industry, transportation infrastructure, and urban lifestyles. To stay competitive, businesses in the automotive and transport sectors need to invest in electric vehicle and autonomous driving technologies, expand EV charging infrastructure, and establish business models that embrace shared mobility.\nUnderstanding and adapting to t\nhese megatrends will be esse\nntial for the success of governments, businesses, and people worldwide in the near future. As an entrepreneur, you should prepare to embrace change, invest in innovation, and develop new skills to take advantage of opportunities and effectively handle the challenges that will arise in 2025 and beyond.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

So, regardless of which aspect of life, we must always be prepared to cope with these changes, especially for entrepreneurs striving for business success.\nToday, let's explore \"\nMegatrends\n,\" which are global-level trends that both marketers and the global population must understand!\nWhat are Megatrends?\nMegatrends are global-scale waves of change that impact every aspect of life. They often occur slowly but have lasting and far-reaching effects. These megatrends are driven by various factors such as technology, society, economy, environment, and more.\nWhy Should Businesses Prioritize Megatrends 2024?\nBusinesses need to prioritize megatrends because these trends are significant factors that impact business operations in various aspects. Here's why:\nStrategic Planning\n: Megatrends provide organizations with an overview of major changes that will occur in the future, enabling them to analyze opportunities and challenges. This helps in devising suitable strategies and adapting promptly.\nProduct and Service Development\n: Understanding customer needs that evolve with Megatrends allows organizations to develop products and services that are relevant and contemporary.\nResource Management\n: Key megatrends such as aging societies and social/environmental changes affect resource management practices such as human resource management, energy management, and sustainable development.\nCompetitive Adaptation\n: Megatrends may introduce new competitors or new competition formats. So, organizations need to closely monitor trends to maintain competitiveness.\nBuilding Trust\n: Prioritizing Megatrends demonstrates an organization's vision and responsibility towards society and the environment, building trust and acceptance among stakeholders.\nIn conclusion, tracking, analyzing, and prioritizing megatrends 2024 is crucial for organizations to effectively plan and adapt to significant changes.\n7 Megatrends for 2024 That Are Worth Noting\n1. Urbanization\nThe world's population continues to migrate towards cities at an increasing rate. Current statistics show that more than half of the world's population resides in urban areas, and it is projected to increase to 68% by 2050. This trend results in densely populated megacities that must cope with challenges such as housing, traffic, pollution, and social inequality. Hence, there is a necessity for modernized infrastructure, efficient public transportation, and proper urban planning to ensure a high quality of life for citizens.\n2. Climate Change\nThe world is currently facing increasingly severe effects of global warming, impacting the environment, economy, and society significantly. Many countries are now prioritizing reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to clean energy, and adopting more environmentally-friendly production and consumption practices, such as reducing plastic usage, utilizing recyclable packaging, and practicing organic farming.\n3. Shifting Economic Power\nIn recent years, there has been a significant shift in the global economy, especially with the rapid growth of developing countries like China, India, and Singapore, while developed economies experience a slowdown. This shift necessitates businesses to adapt their strategies, such as expanding into growing economies and innovating to enhance competitiveness.\n4. Growing Sustainability\nWith various changes occurring, many businesses have realized the necessity of reducing their environmental impact. They integrate sustainable development concepts into their operations, from production to services and supply chains, to ensure long-term quality growth. For example, leading cosmetics and skincare companies are reformulating products to be organic and cruelty-free to meet the preferences of modern consumers, enabling organizations to sustainably grow.\n5. Aging Society\nThe population is aging, coupled with a decreasing trend in childbirth, leading to the emergence of aging societies worldwide.

The pandemic has forced organizations to adapt and find new ways of working. One of the concepts that has gained\nimmense popularity is\n\"Hybrid Working,\"\nwhich involves alternating between work in the office and work from home. Even today\n, many organizations continue to adhere to this work model, and new-generation employees are increasingly seeking\nwork-from-home jobs.\nMany have discovered that the combination of working from home and going to the office better enhances their work-life balance compared to going to the office every day, while also saving costs in various areas.\nTherefore, the qu\nestion arises: Is hybrid work model the stand\nard for modern work? And why should organizations adapt to the new normal by changing their work models? Let's\nWhat is Hybrid Working?\nHybrid working is a work model that allows employees to alternate between work in the office and work from home (or ot\nher locations) as appropriate.\nThis concept combines the advantages of working in the office and remote work, focusing on flexibility and productivity.\nIn\na hybrid working setup, employees may have a predetermined schedule specifying office days and work-from-home days or have the freedom to choose their work locations based on the needs of their tasks and persona\nl preferences. This depends on the organization's policies and the nature of each position.\nThe Benefits of Hybrid Working That Appeal to New-generation Employees\nImproved time and personal life management\nThe hybrid work model enables\nemployees to effectively balance their work and personal lives. The freedom to choose where to work helps reduce stress from commuting and increases time for family or hobbies, leading to an overall improvement in quality of life and higher job satisfaction.\nCost savings\nWork from home on cer\ntain days allows employees to save significantly on expenses, especially commuting and food costs, which can be high for those working in large cities. Additionally, it reduces expenses related to dressing for office work.\nIncreased efficiency and creativity\nHybrid working provides employees with the opportunity to select work environments that suit them and the nature of their tasks each\nday, enabling better focus on their work and stimulating creativity and innovation.\nReduced fatigue from commuting\nFor employees who live far from the office, reducing the number of days spent commuting significantly alleviates fatigue and stress from traffic congestion, allowing them to have more energy and motivation for their work.\nReasons Why Organizations Should Adopt Hybrid Working\nTo attract and retain talented personnel\nCompanies are currently competing to attract highly skilled personnel. Offering a hybrid work model serves as a key selling point for organizations, especially among new-generation workers who prioritize flexibility. Furthermore, it helps organizations retain tale\nnted employees longer since they experience higher job satisfaction.\nTo promote a modern organizational image\nImplementing hybrid working demonstrates that an organization is modern, understands employee needs, and values work-life balance, which enhances its public image and attracts quality clients and employees.\nTo improve efficiency and reduce costs\nHybrid working enables\norganizations to lower expenses related to space and utilities, as it is not necessary to have workspace for every employee simultaneously. It also enhances overall work efficiency, as employees are more satisfied and motivated.\nTo prepare for change\nThe work environment is rapidly changing. Adop\nting hybrid working allows organizations to remain flexible and ready to handle unforeseen situations, such as pande\nmics or natural disasters that may impact office work.\nTo expand recruitment opportunities\nHybrid working open\ns opportunities for organizations to hire talented employees from around the world, not limited to those in close proximity to the office, leading to a broader and higher-quality recruitment pool.\nFuture Trends of Hybrid Working\nAccording to surveys and predictions from experts, there is a clear trend that work-from-home jobs will become an increasingly prevalent work model in the future, supported by the following factors:\nHybrid workplace is gaining acceptance from leading organizations\nMajor companies in the technology sector, such as Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, have officially announced\npermanent hybrid working polic\nies. This trend is likely to encourage other organizations to consider adopting this model as well.\nBecoming a basic requirement for new-generation workers\nMillennials and Gen Z, who will become the primary workforce in the future, place great\nimportance on flexibility and work-life balance. As a result, hybrid work is the model that best meets their needs.\nChanges in urban structure\nHybrid working may lead to a more disp\nersed distribution of housing and workplaces, reducing congestion in large cities and stimulating the economy in suburban areas or smaller towns.\nIncreased emphasis on health and well-being\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, people are placing greater importance on health and well-being.\nHybrid working addr\nesses this need by reducing the risk of disease transmission and enhancing employees' quality of life.\nIn summary, the hybrid work model is likely to become a s\ntandard for modern work. Despite some challenges, the benefits in terms of flexibility, productivity, and employee quality of life make this work model increasingly desirable. However, organizations must remember to plan carefully, invest in appropriate technology, and foster a corporate culture that supports flexible working to prepare for the transition into a new era of work that may change irreversibly.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\n9 Experiential Marketing Trends to Watch in 2030\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n23\n0\n9 Experiential Marketing Trends 2030 Businesses Must Know\nCustomer experience is no l\nonger just about providing good service. It has become the cornerstone of marketing strategy across all sectors—whether in SMEs, retail businesses, or government organizations. But have you ever wondered how experiential marketing trends in 2030 will evolve? With cutting-edge technology as a key driver and consumers expecting more complex, higher standards from brands, the landscape is set for a dramatic shift.\n9 Experiential Marketing Trends 2030: What Consumers Will Expect in the Future ?\n1. Merging the Physical and Digital Worlds (Merged Reality)\nMerged Reality is set to eliminate the divide between “offline” and “online” experiences. Using Mixed Reality (MR) technology, consumers will engage with brands through a hybrid of physical and digital experiences. For example, retail stores might allow customers to try on products from home using MR glasses, or government service centers could offer simulations to teach citizens how to navigate bureaucratic processes. This trend creates new touchpoints that foster a deeper connection with brands—regardless of location.\n2. Immersive, Participatory Experiences\nExperiential marketing in 2030 will move beyond presentation and into full-on participation. Consumers won’t settle for passive advertising—they want to be “players” in the brand experience. Immersive technologies like 360° environments, multi-sensory interaction, and spatial audio will be key features in product demonstrations, events, and even government training. These experiences go beyond visuals to build meaningful, emotional connections with participants.\n3. AI and Automation for Personalized Communication\nAI and machine learning will become core brand ambassadors. Beyond answering questions or recommending products, these technologies will interpret customer needs, communicate naturally, and deliver hyper-relevant experiences. Think human-like chatbots, real-time virtual hosts at events, or auto-generated personalized content based on user context. Strategically implemented, AI will allow brands to offer care and precision that once seemed impossible.\n4. Hyper-Personalization Becomes the New Standard\nHyper-personalization isn’t just about addressing customers by name in emails. It means deeply understanding each individual’s life stage, emotions, and needs at every touchpoint. Brands will use data from multiple sources—click behavior, in-store movement, even health data—to create personalized experiences. For instance, sending a fitness promotion to someone who just joined a gym, or dynamically adjusting app UX to match a user’s style.\n5. Digital Trust as the Foundation of Experience\nBy 2030, trust will no longer be optional—it will be expected. Consumers will choose brands that prioritize transparency and data protection. For experiential marketing 2030, this means building on digital ethics: clear consent policies, data transparency, and secure systems. Brands that fail to deliver on this front, no matter how compelling their experiences, risk swift backlash from consumers and society.\n6. Loyalty Programs as Lifestyle Ecosystems\nLoyalty programs will evolve far beyond points and rewards. They will become ecosystems supporting long-term relationships, integrating with health services, travel, or social initiatives. Customers will enjoy benefits that align with their lifestyle—like converting online shopping points into online course discounts or charitable donations. In experiential marketing trends 2030, brand loyalty will be defined by how well brands support their customers' personal goals.\n7. Digital-First Experiences as the Core Strategy\nFuture products and services will be designed with digital experience at the core—not as a supplementary channel. Picture branchless banks offering fully integrated mobile apps or shopping malls with AR platforms enabling customers to browse from home. A digital-first mindset enables brands to scale efficiently, reduce costs, increase flexibility, and meet the needs of digitally native consumers.\n8. Omnichannel Will Become the Norm\nConsumers will expect seamless experiences across all platforms and physical spaces. They want brands to “remember” and “understand” every interaction—be it a website chat, an in-store purchase, or an event registration. A unified omnichannel approach ensures consistent messaging and functionality, increasing satisfaction and driving repeat purchases.\n9. Sustainability as a Core Principle in Tech Design\nTechnology that performs well must also respect the planet. Experiential marketing in 2030 will spotlight sustainable practices—monitoring the carbon footprint of digital campaigns, efficient use of cloud systems, energy-saving hardware choices, and low-waste events. Brands that demonstrate real environmental commitment and embed ESG principles into their experience design will earn greater consumer loyalty.\nExperiential marketing 2030 goes far beyond using digital tools—it’s about creating a “new world” where brands and consumers connect deeply through immersive technology, AI, trust, and sustainability. Businesses that want to thrive must begin laying this foundation today to keep pace with fast-changing consumer expectations.\nIf your organization is ready to transition into the future of customer experience and marketing, investing in a\ndigital transformation service\nthat understands both technology and business context is key.

This includes training employees to effectively utilize AI in their work and incorporating AI into various operational processes to enhance efficiency and speed.\nRecently, Gartner, a leading global IT research and advisory company, released a study showing that over 55% of organizations worldwide have established a dedicated committee to oversee AI-related tasks, commonly known as an\n\"AI Board.\"\nAdditionally, 54% of organizations have appointed an AI Leader, a role responsible for managing and coordinating AI efforts. According to Frances Karamouzis, Vice President of Research at Gartner, even though there are differing opinions globally regarding the necessity of establishing an AI Board within organizations, it is ultimately acknowledged that having an AI Board is essential for modern organizations. This team drives the potential of AI utilization in a proper and suitable manner.\nWho is the AI Board?\nThe AI Board is a team of personnel consisting of experts from various fields. Their main responsibilities include setting the direction, planning strategies, and overseeing the effective implementation of AI within the organization.\nRoles and Importance of the AI Board\nDefining AI Vision and Strategy\nThe AI Board plays a crucial role in shaping the long-term direction of AI utilization within the organization. This involves setting a clear vision of how AI will be used to create value and competitive advantage. The board must develop strategies aligned with the overall business goals, considering both opportunities and challenges that may arise. Additionally, the team should explore new avenues for applying AI to improve workflows, develop products and services, or create new business models.\nPrioritizing AI Projects\nGiven limited resources, the AI Board is responsible for evaluating and prioritizing various AI projects based on factors such as financial returns, alignment with strategy, technical feasibility, and impact on the organization. The team must decide which projects to invest in first and allocate budget, personnel, and other resources accordingly to ensure the organization maximizes the benefits from AI investments.\nOverseeing Ethics and Responsibility\nThe AI Board must establish clear policies and guidelines for the responsible development and use of AI. This includes addressing issues such as transparency, fairness, non-discrimination, and respect for human rights. They should also implement mechanisms for reviewing and auditing AI system decisions to ensure compliance with ethical standards and relevant laws. Furthermore, the board should promote awareness across all levels of the organization about the importance of ethics in AI usage.\nManaging AI-Related Risks\nThe adoption of AI in organizations may introduce various risks, such as data security, privacy concerns, and impacts on the workforce. The AI Board plays a critical role in identifying, assessing, and managing these risks by developing comprehensive risk management plans, implementing preventive measures, and establishing monitoring systems to detect and respond to potential risks promptly. The board should also consider long-term impacts, such as changes in the labor market, and plan accordingly.\nCultivating an AI-Ready Organizational Culture\nContinuous learning and development of AI skills should be encouraged, along with openness to change and innovation. The AI Board needs to communicate the vision and benefits of AI clearly to employees at all levels, encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes, and foster an environment where employees feel safe to voice their opinions and contribute to AI development within the organization.\nCoordinating Between AI-Related Departments\nThe AI Board must facilitate collaboration among various departments involved with AI, such as IT, R&D, operations, and HR. This involves creating mechanisms for sharing information, knowledge, and resources to ensure effective teamwork. The Board should also help resolve conflicts that may arise and promote the integration of AI into organizational processes.\nMonitoring and Evaluating AI Implementation, and Continuously Improving Strategy\nThe AI Board is responsible for establishing appropriate metrics to evaluate performance, financial returns, and organizational impact across different dimensions. They must analyze this data to assess the success of AI campaigns, identify problems and obstacles, and find opportunities for improvement. This information should be used to continuously refine AI strategies and operations, ensuring that the organization can leverage AI effectively and sustainably.\nComposition of the AI Board\nChief AI Officer (CAIO):\nThe leader responsible for the organization's AI strategy and operations. The CAIO sets the vision and direction for AI implementation.\nData Scientist:\nAn expert in data analysis and interpretation, responsible for designing and developing AI models.\nAI Engineer:\nFocuses on developing and deploying AI systems, as well as maintaining AI infrastructure.\nBusiness Analyst:\nConnects business needs with AI solutions, analyzing the impact and opportunities AI presents to the business.\nLegal Counsel:\nA legal advisor who handles legal matters and ensures compliance with regulations related to AI.\nEthics Officer:\nResponsible for overseeing the ethical use of AI and ensuring responsible AI practices.\nHuman Resources Representative:\nRepresents HR, focusing on the impact of AI on employees and facilitating skill development.\nIT Security Specialist:\nA cybersecurity expert responsible for ensuring the security of AI systems and protecting data.\nDomain Expert:\nA specialist with expertise in the specific industry or field relevant to AI applications.\nProject Manager:\nOversees the planning, execution, and monitoring of various AI-driven campaigns and projects.\nHaving an AI Board not only helps organizations fully leverage the benefits of AI but also demonstrates their commitment to being leaders in innovation and truly adapting to the digital age. Ultimately, organizations that can effectively integrate AI into their business strategies will gain a competitive advantage and create lasting value for their customers, employees, and society.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nAI Search Marketing: How to Keep Your Brand in Search?\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n505\n0\nAI Search Marketing: Boosting Brand Visibility in the AI Era\nFrom the familiar Google search everyone knows, we now have AI-driven search engines that can synthesize information and provide answers tailored to the user’s needs instantly. Whether it’s ChatGPT, Bing Copilot, or Google SGE (Search Generative Experience), these tools present answers that go beyond just listing results from websites. They offer responses that take into account the user's intent and the reliability of the information.\nIn an era where AI plays a central role in information retrieval, adapting to AI Search or\n\"AI Search Marketing\"\nhas become increasingly important. This process ensures that your brand \"appears\" in the answers that AI presents, enabling you to directly reach customers and increase business growth effectively.\nWhat is AI Search Marketing?\nAI Search Marketing is a marketing strategy focused on ensuring your brand \"appears\" or is featured in the responses AI generates when answering user questions. Unlike traditional search engines that pull information solely from websites or databases, AI can now also retrieve data from various other sources such as forums, social media, and open-source databases. This diversity makes AI responses more comprehensive and varied.\nSimply put, AI Search Marketing isn’t just about providing information on your website; it’s about ensuring that your data is selected by AI to be used as an answer—one that aligns with the user’s intent and presents a suitable solution.\nHow Does AI Search Marketing Differ from SEO?\nBoth SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and AI Search Marketing aim to appear in user search results, but they have clearly different approaches and processes:\nSEO to Rank on Google:\nSEO focuses on optimizing a website so that it ranks on traditional search engines like Google. This involves improving content quality and using relevant keywords.\nAI Search Marketing to Be Selected by AI:\nIn contrast, AI Search Marketing focuses on getting your brand’s information selected by AI to be used in its responses. AI pulls from a variety of data sources, such as website content, forum discussions, or social media conversations.\nBehind the Scenes of AI Search\nAI Search Marketing relies on complex processes to synthesize data from multiple sources in order to provide the most accurate and appropriate answers to users. Key steps in this process include:\nUsing Data from Multiple Sources:\nAI pulls from websites, forums, social media, and open-source databases to create the most relevant answer.\nUser Intent Analysis:\nAI analyzes the intent behind the user’s query—whether they are looking for general information, recommendations, or step-by-step guidance (How-to).\nAnswer Synthesis:\nAfter gathering information, AI selects and synthesizes the most relevant and accurate response to meet the user’s needs.\nHow to Do AI Search Marketing and Ensure Your Brand Appears in AI Responses\n1. Create In-Depth and Accurate Content\nCreating detailed content that thoroughly answers user questions is a core strategy in AI Search Marketing. AI pulls data from multiple sources to process and provide the most precise answers. High-quality content should address all aspects of a question and make it easier for AI to select your data as the answer.\nFor example, if a user asks about choosing an energy-efficient air conditioner, the content should cover factors like capacity, energy usage, installation, maintenance, and performance.\n2. Focus on Q&A, How-to, or Pain Point Content\nContent like Q&A or How-to articles is favored by AI, as it directly answers the user's questions. Addressing pain points (problems or needs) is equally important, as it provides practical solutions that users are looking for, especially when they need help solving a specific issue, such as caring for skin dried out by air conditioning.\n3. Use Structured Data / Schema Markup\nStructured Data or Schema Markup organizes information in a way that AI can easily understand. Adding Schema Markup to your website helps AI quickly retrieve and use your data in its responses. For example, if your website contains restaurant information, Schema Markup allows AI to recognize this and use it to answer queries about restaurant locations, menus, and more.\n4. Boost Brand Credibility (E-E-A-T)\nA key factor in getting your brand featured in AI search results is building credibility through E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust. AI prioritizes content from brands that demonstrate high E-E-A-T:\nExperience:\nThe brand's experience in providing services or products.\nExpertise:\nThe brand’s proficiency in its industry.\nAuthoritativeness:\nThe brand’s reputation and industry leadership.\nTrust:\nThe trustworthiness from users or reputable sources.\nA high E-E-A-T score signals to AI that your content is valuable and reliable, increasing the likelihood of it being featured in AI-generated answers.\n5. Distribute Information Across Multiple Channels (Omni-channel Footprint)\nDistributing brand information across various channels increases the likelihood that AI will use your content in its answers. By sharing data through your website, social media, and services like Google My Business, you create a broader presence that AI can pull from, improving the accuracy and relevance of its responses.\n6. Regularly Update Content\nAI tends to favor fresh, up-to-date content. Regularly updating your website ensures your brand's content remains relevant and timely. This could include adding industry updates, addressing frequently asked questions, or correcting errors in older content.\nCase Study: Brands Successfully Using AI Search Marketing\nIn recent years, several brands have succeeded by leveraging AI Search Marketing, particularly within digital marketing and SEO sectors. These brands have attracted attention from AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and other AI platforms.\n1. HubSpot\nHubSpot provides an all-in-one inbound marketing platform that includes tools for CRM, content creation, and digital campaign management. By creating content that answers user questions on various topics like SEO, digital content creation, and online sales techniques, HubSpot has become a go-to resource for AI when responding to queries about marketing.\nHubSpot’s use of Structured Data makes it easy for AI to access and present their content. Regular updates ensure the information remains relevant to current trends and user needs.\n2. Moz\nMoz, a well-known brand in the SEO industry, uses AI Search Marketing effectively by providing in-depth content related to SEO tools and strategies. Their content often comes in the form of Q&A, How-to guides, and expert advice, making it easy for AI to feature Moz’s resources in search results about SEO.\nThe benefits of AI Search Marketing are vast. It enhances your brand's visibility in AI-powered search engines, directly targets users with high-quality, relevant answers, and improves the chances of increasing engagement and conversions. Brands that align their content strategy with AI search capabilities not only improve their search ranking but also become more relevant to users’ needs, driving business growth.\nBy quickly adjusting your strategies to work with AI, partnering with a\ntech agency\nthat specializes in data analysis and digital marketing can ensure your strategies are both effective and up-to-date. This will give you a competitive edge and open up more opportunities to grow and expand your customer base in today’s digital world.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Consumers can be influenced to change their behavior through something as simple as design—no coercion, no explicit guidance, just the creative shaping of an environment that fosters conversions!\nBehavioral design is a gr\noundbreaking concept set to revolutionize innovation. It sits at the intersection of psychology, design, and\ntechnology\n, transforming how we think about influencing society. Let’s dive deeper into h\now behavioral design is c\nonnected to marketing and how it can drive impactful change.\nWhat is Behavioral Design?\nBehavioral design, literally translated as “designing behavior,” closely aligns with its practical application in marketing. It refers to the strategic and effective design of experiences, products, or services aimed at influencing and changing the behavior of target audiences.\nThis concept integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines—psychology, design, and technology—to create measurable outcomes. Behavioral design is not just about aesthetics; it’s about crafting purposeful environments that guide actions and drive desired results.\nThe Three Key Components of Behavioral Design\n1. Behavioral Psychology\nUnderstanding the decision-making mechanisms of the target audience is fundamental to\nBehavioral design\n. Marketers need to thoroughly analyze both the motivations driving actions and the barriers preventing behavioral change. By identifying why people do or don’t engage in certain behaviors, marketers can design more precise and effective solutions.\n2. Experience Design\nEnvironments and touchpoints have a significant influence on user behavior. Effective design should create experiences with the following characteristics:\nFacilitate desired actions.\nSimplify usability and reduce complexity.\nProvide motivation through appropriate rewards, such as promotions or discounts.\nFeature clear and intuitive UI/UX design.\n3. Data Analytics\nIn the era of\ndigital transformation\n, leveraging big data and machine learning is essential for tracking and measuring behavioral changes. These tools enable marketers to analyze and improve customer experiences while predicting future behaviors and market trends. By using data-driven insights, strategies can be refined for maximum impact.\nKey Techniques in Behavioral Design\n1. Nudge Theory\nThis theory focuses on subtly “nudging” or stimulating the thoughts, feelings, or actions of the target audience through clever design that guides decision-making without forcing or limiting user choices. For example, placing healthy food prominently in a cafeteria encourages people to choose healthier options simply by increasing their visibility.\n2. Gamification\nThis involves incorporating game mechanics and elements into non-game contexts to foster engagement and motivation. Examples include point systems, unlocking achievements, competing with others, or earning rewards. Gamification is widely used in designing digital products and services because it effectively drives user participation.\n3. Choice Architecture\nThis concept emphasizes designing how options are presented to users, aiming to help them make better decisions. It is based on the understanding that human decision-making is not always rational and is often influenced by the presentation of information and contextual factors. Marketers must carefully consider how to structure and present choices to optimize outcomes.\nPros and Cons of Behavioral Design\nPros of Behavioral Design\nEnhances behavioral change:\nBy leveraging proven psychological principles, Behavioral Design naturally and effectively influences human behavior.\nCreates user-centric experiences:\nDesigning with real user needs and behaviors in mind leads to higher satisfaction and fosters long-term engagement.\nMeasurable and systematic improvement:\nThe use of data and in-depth analysis allows for systematic measurement and continuous refinement of outcomes.\nCost-effective in the long run:\nProper design reduces the need for costly corrections, increases user retention, and strengthens brand loyalty, ultimately saving resources over time.\nCons of Behavioral Design\nRisk of perceived manipulation:\nSome consumers may feel their behavior is being controlled or overly influenced. Transparency in design is essential to mitigate this concern.\nResource and time intensive:\nBehavioral design\nrequires significant investment in research and data analysis during the development phase, though it often proves worthwhile over time.\nUncertain and time-dependent outcomes:\nHuman behavior is complex and unpredictable, often influenced by uncontrollable external factors. Achieving results throug\nh behavioral design requires p\natience and consistent effort.\n﻿\nBehavioral Design in Real-World Business Examples\nSpotify\n,\na standout example of\nbehavioral design in the music streaming industry. The platform uses algorithms to analyze individual user beha\nvior, such as which songs are played, skipped, or added to playlists. This data is then processed to create a personalized music experience, encouraging users to continue engaging with the app based on their preferences and listening habits.\nDuolingo\n, a language-learning platform, effectively use\ns behavioral design to keep users engaged in their lessons like a game. The platform employs a streak system\nthat motivates learners to return daily to maintain their learning streak. It also breaks lessons into small, manageable units that can be completed quickly, making users feel a sense of progress and accomplishment, which helps sustain their learning habit.\nAs a new-generation marketer, always remember that we're not just designing products or services; we are designing the experiences and consumer behaviors that drive business results. However, when applying behavioral design to marketing, it is crucial t\no consider ethics, respect privacy, and uphold human rights to demonstrate sincerity towards consumers. This approach is essential for achieving long-term success in the marketing world in a sustainable manner.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

However, some still worry that artificial intelligence robots may not perform certain tasks as efficiently as humans, such as programming, which can be prone to redundancy or errors.\nTo address these concerns, OpenAI has developed a tool called\n“CriticGPT,”\na model built on GPT-4, designed to review and analyze code generated by ChatGPT to ensure more accurate results. According to OpenAI's research, using CriticGPT to assist AI trainers has improved error detection by up to 63%.\nWhat is CriticGPT?\nCriticGPT is an AI system developed to inspect and identify potential errors in code, as well as to provide suggestions for improving code quality.\nIt utilizes Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing technologies to analyze the structure and logic of the code, enabling it to accurately identify issues related to performance, security, and design.\nIn addition to highlighting flaws, CriticGPT offers concrete solutions and explains the reasoning behind them, helping developers learn and continuously improve their coding skills. It can also be tailored to align with the specific coding standards of each organization, making CriticGPT an invaluable tool for developing high-quality and reliable software.\nWhat are the Benefits of CriticGPT?\nReduces Code Review Time\nCriticGPT can analyze a large volume of code in a short amount of time, accurately identifying hidden issues, which significantly saves time on code reviews. Developers no longer have to manually check each line. Moreover, the tool can inspect various aspects of code, including adherence to style guides, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.\nEnhances Software Security\nCriticGPT helps developers identify potential security vulnerabilities before the software is deployed, reducing the risk of cyber-attacks. It also assists developers in complying with various security standards, such as the OWASP Top 10, ensuring more secure software development.\nImproves Performance\nWith features that offer recommendations on code optimization and the use of appropriate functions, CriticGPT enhances the overall effectiveness of the code. Detecting and fixing issues early on also reduces the number of bugs during the development process and post-launch, thereby lowering the cost of later troubleshooting.\nMinimizes Errors\nCriticGPT can accurately detect both syntax and logical errors. Upon identifying any mistakes, the system immediately provides suggestions for correction, allowing developers to address and overcome obstacles quickly and efficiently.\nLimitations of CriticGPT That Should Be Aware Of\nLimited Ability to Provide Long Explanations\nCriticGPT often gives concise answers, which can make it challenging to fully understand the root causes of problems and how to fix them, especially when dealing with highly complex code.\nCannot Fully Replace Humans or Eliminate Errors Completely\nWhile CriticGPT helps reduce the number of errors, it cannot identify and fix all mistakes, particularly those that are complex or previously unseen. Therefore, developers still need to be actively involved in thoroughly reviewing and correcting code.\nConcise Responses May Lead to Incomplete Error Identification\nAs CriticGPT tends to give brief and concise responses, it may sometimes overlook certain types of hidden errors or those related to the surrounding context, leading to incomplete error identification.\nDifficulty Analyzing Highly Complex Work\nCriticGPT may struggle to analyze very complex code, such as code written in less common programming languages or domain-specific code, which requires specialized knowledge and experience that only human developers possess.\nNonetheless, CriticGPT is a reasonably powerful tool for helping software developers review and improve the quality of code generated by ChatGPT. With its ability to analyze code and provide useful recommendations, CriticGPT serves as a valuable aid that can enhance the efficiency of the software development process to some extent.\nIt is important to remember that CriticGPT is not a replacement for the expertise of developers but rather a tool to complement and support their work. Therefore, developers should use CriticGPT alongside their own knowledge and experience to create high-quality software that truly meets users' needs.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nHow Japan Uses AI and Technology for Earthquake Preparedness\nTechnology\nEducation\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n19\n0\nInnovating Earthquake Preparedness in Japan with AI\nJapan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, particularly in the southern part of the Japanese archipelago, which lies along major seismic fault lines. These areas frequently experience large-scale earthquakes capable of causing significant damage to life, property, and public infrastructure. In response, the Japanese government and research organizations have been actively advancing cutting-edge technology to strengthen early warning systems and reduce the devastating impacts of natural disast\ners. One of the most promising developments in recent years is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in earthquake preparedness—specifically for prediction, analysis, and systematic response.\nReal-Time AI Technology for Earthquake Epicenter Detection\nOne breakthrough innovation is an AI earthquake prediction system developed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). This system accurately detects the epicenter of earthquakes occurring along the Nankai Trough. Previously, location estimates could deviate by up to 20 kilometers, but the AI has reduced that margin to just a few kilometers—calculating it within only five seconds.\nThis AI earthquake prediction in Japan uses 3D seismic wave data from high-risk zones to provide real-time analysis. It enables agencies like the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue timely earthquake or tsunami warnings, significantly increasing response speed.\nHigh-precision data in the critical seconds after an earthquake strikes is crucial to minimizing loss of life and property, allowing for faster evacuations and emergency responses.\nAI Earthquake Preparedness Models for Soil Stability and Liquefaction Risk\nAnother significant development is a 3D soil analysis model created by the Shibaura Institute of Technology. This AI earthquake preparedness system uses Artificial Neural Networks and Assembled Learning to evaluate the risk of liquefaction—a phenomenon where the ground turns into liquid due to seismic vibrations. This condition is a major cause of structural collapse in coastal and soft-soil areas.\nThe model enables:\nUrban planners to identify “safe zones” for construction.\nEngineers to design structures suited to the soil profile of each area.\nLocal governments to implement comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures.\nStrategic Business and Government Benefits of Earthquake Preparedness in Japan\nAI in earthquake preparedness is more than an engineering tool—it also serves as a strategic asset for businesses and public sector planning:\nSite selection:\nHelps assess seismic risk before investing in office buildings or warehouses.\nInsurance planning:\nInforms premium negotiations through detailed risk analysis.\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP):\nProvides accurate data to build emergency response strategies.\nUrban alert systems:\nMinimizes social and economic disruption by enabling faster evacuation in densely populated areas.\nExpanding the Role of BCP in the Thai Business Context\nFor Thai businesses, particularly those operating factories, energy grids, or large warehouses in risk-prone zones, having a BCP is critical. AI systems that analyze seismic history and soil composition in real time can help executives:\nChoose safer locations for expansion.\nRelocate or segment critical operations.\nBuild more resilient supply chains.\nAdditionally, AI simulation tools can model scenarios such as seismic vibrations or evacuation routes, allowing organizations to create actionable BCPs that reduce potential harm to people and operations during unexpected events.\nOpportunity for Thailand to Adapt Japan’s Model\n﻿\nAlthough Thailand is not located in a major seismic zone like Japan, tremors can still occur—particularly in the North and West due to proximity to neighboring countries. In recent years, earthquakes have even been felt in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Sawan, and Phuket, including a notable event on March 28, 2025.\nAdopting learnings from AI earthquake prediction in Japan offers Thailand several benefits:\nDeveloping a domestic early warning system.\nUsing soil data for urban planning and structural design.\nEnhancing business resilience against climate and natural disasters.\nOne promising initiative could involve applying Japanese AI models in high-risk provinces like Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Tak. These areas have reported tremors from Myanmar, and collaborations between geoscience agencies, universities, and local governments could lead to 3D soil modeling and the installation of deep seismic sensors—setting the foundation for a robust national disaster response system.\nPrivate-sector companies in real estate and infrastructure can also utilize this data to build safer, more sustainable projects aligned with long-term development goals.\nJapan’s strategic use of AI to manage natural disasters—especially earthquakes—demonstrates how real-time, data-driven analysis can save lives and improve resilience. These technologies are not only essential for public safety but also for empowering businesses and governments to prepare for an uncertain future. If Thailand can adapt these innovations into its own national planning, the result could be a smarter, safer, and more stable society.\nFor organizations looking to implement advanced\ntech solutions for businesses\n.\nJenosize\nis ready to be your trusted technology partner.

    "content": "<\nBack\n7 Storytelling Techniques Brands Should Use to Stand Out\nMarketing\nBusiness\nMotivation\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n46\n0\n7 Proven Storytelling Techniques That Make Brands Memorable\nEvery time you scroll through social media, you're hit with a rapid flood of content. In today’s hyper-competitive business world, success isn’t just measured by numbers or data—it’s also about how well you communicate your message. That’s where\nstorytelling\ncomes in. This powerful communication skill can transform basic information into an emotional experience that captures attention and drives consumer action.\nIf your brand aims to stand out, mastering and applying business storytelling techniques effectively is a crucial tool. It helps enhance brand perception, boost audience engagement, and drive sustainable business results.\nWhy Storytelling Is a Must-Have Skill in Today’s World ?\nWhat is storytelling? It’s both a science and an art—not just presenting facts, but crafting emotionally resonant narratives that connect with your audience.\nResearch from\nThe New York Times\nfound that while data-driven content only activates the part of the brain responsible for basic language processing, compelling storytelling techniques trigger multiple regions of the brain, including those linked to sensory experiences. This makes stories far more memorable and engaging than standard communication.\n7 Storytelling Techniques Every Brand Should Use\n1. Choose the Right Story at the Right Time\nNot every campaign needs to tell your brand’s full history. Select a story that aligns with the current context and resonates with your audience. A good story should immediately answer the question, “Why does this matter to me?” and spark emotional responses like empathy, curiosity, or inspiration—leading your audience to take action.\n2. Start with a Strong Hook\nIn an era where users decide within seconds whether to keep watching, a compelling hook is everything. It could be a thought-provoking question, a surprising statistic, or an emotionally charged statement. The goal is to make people want to know what happens next.\n3. Structure Your Story with Purpose\nGreat storytelling needs clear structure. One effective method is the IRS Model, which brings balance and emotional momentum to your narrative:\nIntriguing Beginning – Open with something that piques curiosity.\nRiveting Middle – Introduce a twist, challenge, or conflict that builds anticipation.\nSatisfying Ending – Conclude with a clear takeaway that encourages decision-making.\n4. Use Relatable and Universal Plotlines\nOne of the core principles of effective storytelling techniques is using universally understood plot structures. This makes it easier for your audience to connect with your message and see the human side of your brand. Examples include:\nOrigin Story – Share how your brand or product began.\nUnderdog Story – Tell of someone who overcame the odds.\nOvercoming the Monster – Highlight challenges your brand or customer conquered.\n5. Use Analogies to Explain Complex Ideas\nTo simplify complex topics, use analogies or metaphors. For instance, explain strategic planning as a chess match, or compare using cloud services to renting an office rather than building one. This not only makes your content easier to understand but also adds creativity to your narrative.\n6. View the Story from the Audience’s Perspective\nPut yourself in your audience’s shoes. What are their expectations, fears, or pain points? Then design your story to meet them there. When you tailor your narrative to their emotional and informational needs, it becomes the solution they’ve been looking for—not just another message from a brand.\n7. Use the Right Tone of Voice\nEven the best story can fall flat if delivered in the wrong tone. Match your tone to your brand identity, audience, and platform. For example, a TikTok video may call for a friendly and casual tone, while website content may require a more formal and credible voice.\nCase Study: Brands That Excel at Storytelling\nThai Life Insurance\nA standout example of storytelling in action is Thai Life Insurance. Known for emotionally powerful yet simple narratives, their campaigns often focus on everyday people making sacrifices for others or overcoming hardships. These stories are crafted to evoke empathy and convey deep life values, making them truly unforgettable.\nNike\nNike has long mastered strategic storytelling—especially through tales of athletes pushing past their limits to achieve greatness. Campaigns like “Just Do It” and stories of individuals who weren’t born champions but fought their way to success inspire audiences by reinforcing the message: If they can do it, so can I.\nIt's clear that storytelling is an essential skill for brands of all sizes. In a world overwhelmed by information, businesses must differentiate themselves through goal-driven, emotionally resonant narratives that align with their audience’s core values. While data and statistics may be forgotten, a story that touches the heart will always be remembered.\nIf you're an entrepreneur looking to clearly and effectively communicate your brand identity, we’re here to help turn your message into a memorable campaign.

    "content": "<\nBack\n9 MrBeast-Style Video Marketing Tricks for Viral Content\nTechnology\nMarketing\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n341\n0\nBreaking Down MrBeast’s Videos Formula for Viral Content\nAs consumers spend hours each day on video platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Video, video marketing has become a critical strategy for businesses of all sizes. Among the most successful examples of viral video creation is “MrBeast,” a YouTube content creator with over 200 million subscribers worldwide. His structured, methodical approach to content production offers valuable lessons that can be effectively adapted for Thai businesses and beyond.\n9 Strategies for Making MrBeast-Style Video Marketing to Maximize Viral Potential\n1. A Great Video Isn't Just Visually Appealing — It Must Be Watched Until the End\nOne of the core principles behind how MrBeast makes videos is maximizing the \"Retention Rate,\" or the percentage of viewers who watch until the end. Attractive visuals and clear audio are not enough; videos must be designed to captivate and sustain audience interest throughout.\nA key tip is to identify moments where viewers are likely to drop off and restructure the video to ensure that the beginning and middle sections are the strongest, keeping audiences engaged for as long as possible.\n2. Titles and Thumbnails Matter More Than You Think\nWhen it comes to MrBeast videos, the importance of the \"Title\" and \"Thumbnail\" cannot be overstated. These elements are the first impressions that determine whether someone clicks or scrolls past.\nEffective strategies include crafting emotionally charged, story-driven titles—such as transforming “Trying to Stay in Front of a House for 50 Hours” into “Challenge Accepted! Surviving 50 Hours Outside My House!”—and designing eye-catching thumbnails that accurately reflect the video’s content to maintain credibility.\n3. The Golden Minute: Hook Viewers in the First 60 Seconds\nAccording to MrBeast's team, the sharpest drop-off in viewership occurs within the first minute. To succeed, make videos like MrBeast by starting with a bang—whether it's a surprising event, a provocative question, or diving straight into the action within the first 60 seconds. Failing to captivate viewers early drastically reduces overall video performance.\n4. Re-Engage Every Three Minutes\nEffective video marketing requires building in “Re-Engagement Points” roughly every three minutes. This could include plot twists, unexpected reveals, or humorous moments—techniques frequently seen in MrBeast videos. Regularly rekindling viewer interest is crucial to maintaining attention until the video’s conclusion.\n5. Create a Unique \"WOW Factor\" That Can't Be Imitated\nWhat sets MrBeast videos apart is their unreplicable \"WOW Factor\"—whether it’s lifting an entire house with a crane or giving away half a million dollars in a simple game.\nBrands can adapt this approach by launching unique campaigns that break industry norms, such as unexpected product giveaways or surprising collaborations with influencers.\n6. Creativity Beats Expensive Gear\nOne vital insight from how MrBeast makes videos is that creativity outweighs equipment quality. The MrBeast team focuses on developing fresh ideas rather than relying on professional-grade gear. A compelling story will always outperform the mere use of expensive cameras. In short: don’t let technical limitations hinder creativity.\n7. Know Exactly What Moment You’re Filming\nEvery piece of content produced by MrBeast undergoes meticulous structural planning. Teams know exactly what minute or second of the video they are shooting, allowing them to tailor tone, pacing, and excitement levels to audience expectations. For example:\nMinute 1: Peak excitement\nMinutes 1–3: Rapid storytelling\nMinutes 3–6: Quick scene changes to sustain momentum\nMinute 6 onward: Big reveals and an unforgettable finale\n8. Never Leave Critical Tasks Unsupervised\nOne of MrBeast’s golden rules is: Never assume others will handle critical tasks with the same care you would. Whether it’s equipment preparation, shooting logistics, or backup planning, creators must personally oversee all key details to ensure seamless execution. This principle applies to all levels of video marketing—thorough involvement is non-negotiable.\n9. Rethink Product Placement: From \"Inserting Ads\" to \"Building Content Together\"\nAnother secret behind the success of MrBeast videos is how seamlessly brands are integrated into the story, rather than feeling like disruptive ads.\nExamples include making a brand part of a major prize giveaway or incorporating a sponsor’s product naturally into a challenge. Instead of traditional, overt advertising, the brand becomes an engaging and organic element of the video itself.\nWhile few businesses have resources comparable to MrBeast, understanding viewer behavior and intelligently structuring content can significantly boost performance.\nToday’s video marketing landscape isn’t about the most expensive cameras or biggest production budgets—it’s about knowing your audience and telling stories that resonate in the shortest time possible.\nIf your business is looking for guidance or a team of experts to help plan this kind of impactful content strategy, consulting with a professional\ndigital marketing agency\nthat specializes in video strategy is an excellent way to take your campaigns further than you ever imagined!\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

This approach targets customers’ hearts during the most vibrant and high-spending time of the year.\nWhat is Festive Marketing?\nFestive marketing is a marketing str\nategy that leverages festivals or holidays as the key selling point to capture customer interest\nand drive sales to exceed targets. Whether it’s New Year, Valentine’s Day, Songkran, Halloween, or even online shopping festivals like Double Date campaigns and Black Frida\ny, festive season marketing plays a crucial role.\nAlso known as holiday marketing, this approach focuses on creating holiday marketing campaigns that resonate with the emotions and sentiments of consumers during s\npecific festive periods. The main goals are to attract attention, generate demand, and ultimately maximize sales.\nWhy is Festive Season Promotion Effective?\nFestive seasons put consumers in a good mood and ready to spend\nFestive periods are special times when consumers tend to be happier, more positive, and more willing to spend money. Whether it’s buying gifts, traveling, or creating special experiences, marketers can tap into these emotions to drive increased purchases of products and services.\nFOMO Behavior (Fear of Missing Out)\nFestive marketing strategies\nleverage the consumer's “fear of missing out” by offering exclusive deals, limited-time discounts, or festival-only promotions. This creates a sense of urgency, making customers feel they’ll miss out on great opportunities if they don’t buy now.\nConsumers plan their purchases ahead of time during festive seasons\nMost consumers plan their shopping in advance for festivals, especially for gifts, souvenirs, or celebration preparations. This gives marketers a golden opportunity to present products and services that align with the target audience's needs and preferences.\nStrategies for Successful Festive Marketing\nIdentify the Golden Timing of Each Festival\nTiming is key to executing an effect\nive festive marketing strategy. Each festival comes with its own timeframe and emotional a\nppeal, so marketers need to plan ahead and act at the right moment. For example:\nNew Year:\nStart planning and communicating from mid-December.\nValentine’s Day:\nLaunch\nholiday marketing campaigns from late Ja\nnuary.\nSongkran (Thai New Year)\nPrepare\nfestive promotion sta\nrting in March.\nCreate Unique Experiences\nCrafting tailored experiences for customers during each festive period helps leave a lasting impression and creates positive memories. This can be achieved through:\nDesigning special gift packages.\nBuilding campaigns with emotional storytelling.\nOrganizing special events or engaging challenges.\nUse Content to Inspire Purchase Intent\nEffective marketing content acts like a story, subtly building emotions and driving consumer demand. Brands should not only showcase products but also create shared experiences and emotional connections with customers through:\nShort videos with impactful stories and emotions.\nBeautiful visuals that convey the product’s value impressively.\nInspirational storytelling that connects products with customers' dreams and goals.\nReal user reviews and testimonials that build trust and credibility.\nOffer Compelling Promotions to Attract Consumers\nAttractive festive promotion is critical to grabbing consumer attention. Beyond\nsimple discounts, brands can add value in other creative ways, such as:\nSpecial giveaways with meaningful value for users.\nFlexible installment options to ease financial burdens.\nSatisfaction guarantees to instill confidence in customers.\nProfessional Planning for Festive Season Promotion\nPrepare Holiday Marketing Campaigns in Advance\nStart by gaining a deep understanding of the festival context, consumer sentiment, and business goals. This planning process includes several critical steps, such as:\nDesigning creative content that aligns with the emotions and context of the festival.\nSetting an accurate advertising budget based on business goals and expected returns.\nChoose the Right Channels\nEach platform has its own strengths and user demographics, so no single channel can replace another. Marketers must analyze which platforms suit their brand best:\nFacebook:\nIdeal for detailed advertising and reaching a diverse age range of users.\nInstagram:\nAttracts consumers through stunning visuals and videos, perfect for image-driven products.\nTikTok:\nEngages younger audiences with creative and entertaining content.\nE-commerce:\nA direct sales channel that effectively tracks measurable results.\nMeasure and Adjust Strategies Using Clear KPIs\nMeasuring and refining strategies is like using a compass to guide your marketing journey. Defining clear KPIs is crucial, as these metrics will help you understand consumer behavior, needs, and campaign performance. Key indicators include:\nSales performance\nEngagement rates\nAd click-through rates (CTR)\nConversion rates\nHow to Boost Product Sales During Festivals with Festive Marketing\nUtilize Influencer Marketing\nInfluencer marketing\nis a powerful tool to connect brands with target audiences. Brands should carefully select influencers who align with the following criteria:\nHave followers that match the target customer group\nCredibility and an image consistent with the brand\nAbility to create engaging and compelling content\nOffer Limited Edition Products\nLimited edition products, or items with restricted availability, can generate excitement and a sense of urgency. During festivals, brands should:\nDesign unique, special-edition products exclusive to the season\nPromote the idea that once sold out, they won’t be restocked, creating a “must-own” feeling among shoppers\nSend Exclusive Deals to Existing Customers via Email or Apps\nRetaining loyal customers\nis just as important as attracting new ones. Brands can:\nSend special deals through emails or applications to encourage repeat purchases\nShow appreciation and remind customers of their importance\nUse loyalty programs, like reward points or exclusive gifts, to strengthen customer relationships and boost brand loyalty\nDesign Holiday Marketing Campaigns That Encourage Sharing\nCreating sh\nareable holiday marketing campaigns can amplify brand reach and awareness during festive seasons. Brands can:\nDevelop creative, unique, and attention-grabbing content that customers want to share\nIntroduce fun challenges with opportunities for consumers to compete for rewards\nOffer incentives for sharing, which helps significantly increase brand visibility and engagement\nIn the highly competitive world of marke\nting, adapting to customer behavior during festive seasons is crucial. Creative and well-targeted festive marketing strategies not only drive sales but also build lasting relationships with customers.

    "content": "<\nBack\nLIVE Commerce is Booming! 7 Tips to Boost Sales via LIVE\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n591\n0\n7 Expert Tips to Boost Sales with LIVE Commerce\nIn today’s rapidly evolving digital marketing landscape, one trend that has gained significant popularity is\nLIVE commerce\n—the practice of selling products through LIVE streaming on online platforms. The combination of LIVE video and e-commerce not only creates a more immersive shopping experience, but it can also effectively drive customer purchasing decisions. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or retail businesses looking to increase sales and reach their target audience more accurately, adopting LIVE commerce is a strategy you should not overlook!\nWhat is LIVE Commerce, and Why Is It Gaining Popularity?\nLIVE commerce is the process of selling products through LIVE streaming, which allows sellers to engage with customers in real-time.\nDuring a LIVE broadcast, sellers can introduce products, answer customer questions, and interact with the audience, providing detailed product information that makes it easier for consumers to make purchasing decisions. The benefits of LIVE commerce, which have made LIVE selling so popular, include:\nReal-time interaction:\nCustomers can ask questions about products and receive immediate answers from the seller, which helps reduce concerns and boosts their confidence in making a purchase.\nImpulse buying through promotions:\nSpecial discounts or flash sales during LIVE broadcasts encourage customers to buy quickly.\nIncreased reach and engagement:\nLIVE streaming allows you to reach a broad audience instantly and engage with them in an efficient, interactive way.\nReal-time product reviews:\nCustomers can witness LIVE demonstrations of products, which helps alleviate concerns about product quality.\nHow to Do LIVE Commerce: 7 Proven Techniques to Boost Your Sales\n1. Plan Content and Strategy Before Going LIVE\nBefore you start your LIVE stream, it’s essential to plan the content in advance to ensure the broadcast is clear and has a clear direction. Set topics to discuss, such as product launches, reviews, or special promotions. Organize the order of product presentations systematically, which helps keep the LIVE session smooth and engaging for your audience.\nSpecial Tip:\nUse the \"Before-After\" technique to show the clear results of using your product. For example, show a before image of a common issue, such as acne (Before), and then demonstrate the result after using your product, like clear, glowing skin (After), to help viewers understand the product’s benefits more clearly.\n2. Choose the Right Platform for Your Target Audience\nSelecting the right platform for your target audience is crucial to ensure your LIVE broadcast gains the most interest from the right viewers. Consider how to do LIVE commerce on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Choose the platform where your audience is most active, making it easier for them to join and engage with your LIVE session.\nSpecial Tip:\nUnderstand which platforms your target audience uses most frequently and where you're likely to get the best response. For example, TikTok is ideal for younger audiences, Instagram is perfect for showcasing a stylish, visually appealing brand image, and Facebook allows access to a wide range of age groups.\n3. Use Storytelling to Captivate Your Audience\nTelling an engaging story about your products or services can help capture your audience's attention. Effective techniques include the \"Before-After\" or \"Problem-Stimulate-Solve\" methods. These strategies clearly demonstrate the benefits of your product. For example:\n\"Did you know that 90% of wrinkles are caused by UV rays?\" (Problem)\n\"Even on cloudy days, UV rays can penetrate and damage your skin’s collagen.\" (Stimulate)\n\"Our sunscreen protects against UV rays and prevents wrinkles with SPF 50+ PA++++.\" (Solve)\n4. Ask Questions and Use Activities to Encourage Engagement\nEngaging your audience through polls, questions, or activities increases participation. For example, offering giveaways to viewers who share your LIVE stream or ask questions about the product encourages more interaction. Activities like randomly selecting winners to receive free products or discount codes can further boost engagement.\n5. Apply Urgency & Scarcity Strategies\nCreating a sense of urgency and scarcity can push customers to make faster purchase decisions. Announce limited stock or exclusive promotions available only during the LIVE stream. This generates excitement and prompts quicker buying decisions. Examples:\n\"Limited stock available—order now before it’s gone!\"\n\"Special promotion! Get 20% off today only during this LIVE session!\"\n6. Promote Your LIVE Session Effectively Before and After\nPromoting your LIVE stream in advance generates anticipation and lets your audience know when and where to tune in. After the LIVE session, promoting highlights or product reviews will allow those who missed the LIVE broadcast to watch it later.\nSpecial Tip:\nUse social media platforms like Instagram Stories or Facebook posts to announce your LIVE session in advance. Afterward, upload a highlight reel or product review for those who missed the LIVE event.\n7. Analyze Results and Improve Your Strategy\nAfter your LIVE session ends, it’s crucial to analyze the results, including the number of viewers, engagement levels, and sales. This data will help you refine your LIVE commerce strategy for future sessions. By identifying what worked well and what needs improvement, you can optimize your approach for even better results.\nSpecial Tip:\nReview comments and feedback from your viewers to understand what they liked or didn’t like. Use this information to enhance your strategy and tailor your LIVE commerce sessions to better meet your audience's needs.\nLIVE commerce is a powerful tool for boosting sales and building real-time customer relationships. For SMEs or retail businesses looking to implement this\nretail marketing\nstrategy, focusing on content planning, choosing the right platform, employing storytelling techniques, and encouraging customer engagement will help you succeed. By applying the right strategies, LIVE commerce can become a highly effective tool for expanding your business and increasing sales opportunities in the digital age.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nSEO, SEM, and SMM: Which is Right for Your Business?\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n243\n0\nSEO vs SEM vs SMM: Which Strategy Is Best for Your Business?\nWhether you run a small, medium, or large business, everyone is looking for the best strategy to drive growth and increase sales. One of the most common questions in the world of online marketing is,\n\"Which is more important between SEO, SEM, and SMM (Social Media Marketing)?\"\nThere is no definitive answer to this question because each of these strategies plays a unique role, but they can all work together effectively to enhance each other.\nWhat is SEO? Understanding Search Engine Optimization as an Online Marketing Channel\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a strategy aimed at improving a website's ranking in search engine results like Google.\nWhen implementing SEO, marketers consider various factors that affect search rankings, such as choosing the right keywords, optimizing the website structure, and creating high-quality content to signal to search engines that the website is a valuable source of information.\nAdvantages of SEO\nBuilds Organic Traffic:\nAttracts website visitors through organic search results without additional costs.\nBoosts Brand Credibility:\nWebsites ranking high on Google are often perceived as more trustworthy than competitors.\nLow Long-Term Costs:\nOnce a website achieves a good ranking, maintaining that ranking doesn't require extra costs.\nImproves Conversion Rates:\nTraffic from search results is often more likely to convert into sales or services than traffic from other channels.\nLimitations of SEO\nTime-Consuming:\nIt takes time and continuous effort to see clear results.\nHighly Competitive:\nEspecially in industries with numerous competitors.\nRequires Technical Understanding:\nSEO involves restructuring the website and selecting the right keywords.\nWhat is SEM? Understanding Online Advertising Strategies with Search Engine Marketing\nSEM (Search Engine Marketing)\nis a strategy that uses paid ads through search engines like Google Ads to quickly increase website traffic. With SEM, marketers pay search engines to display their websites in high positions on search results.\nAdvantages of SEM\nImmediate Targeting:\nAccess your audience immediately after launching ads.\nClear Budget Control:\nMarketers can set specific budgets and objectives for their campaigns.\nEffective for Short-Term Promotions:\nSEM is ideal for promoting products or services when quick results are needed.\nLimitations of SEM\nHigh Long-Term Costs:\nContinuous spending is required to maintain ad positions in prime spots.\nOngoing Monitoring:\nSEM campaigns need frequent adjustments and monitoring to remain effective.\nKeyword Bidding Competition:\nPopular keywords can lead to higher advertising costs.\nWhat is Social Media Marketing? Leveraging Social Platforms for Brand Promotion\nSocial Media Marketing (SMM) involves using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn to promote products and services\n, build brand awareness, and engage with customers. SMM enables businesses to reach a large audience in a short amount of time and interact with customers through engaging content.\nAdvantages of Social Media Marketing\nQuick Audience Reach:\nSMM helps businesses engage with customers rapidly.\nEnhances Customer Engagement:\nSMM enables close interaction between brands and customers.\nSupports Various Content Formats:\nImages, videos, and text can be used to promote products.\nReal-Time Strategy Adjustments:\nMarketers can change strategies immediately when content isn't performing well.\nLimitations of Social Media Marketing\nRequires Constant Content Management:\nTo keep content interesting, ongoing updates are essential.\nPotential Reach Decline:\nChanging platform algorithms may reduce post reach.\nInvestment in Paid Ads:\nPaid ads are often needed to reach a broader audience and increase visibility.\nComparison of SEO, SEM, and SMM: Which Is More Important?\nThe answer to this question depends on your business goals. If you want to build sustainable traffic and establish long-term credibility, SEO is the best strategy. If you need fast and effective reach to increase visibility quickly, SEM is the right choice. On the other hand, if your goal is to engage customers rapidly, increase brand awareness, and boost engagement, Social Media Marketing (SMM) will be the most suitable option.\nHowever, online marketing doesn’t have to be limited to just one strategy. Combining SEO, SEM, and SMM can lead to the best results for your business. For example, you could use SEO to attract customers through search results, while using social media to maintain customer relationships or SEM to increase reach in a limited time and immediately capture customer interest.\nIn conclusion, whether SEO, SEM, or SMM, all these strategies are important. Each has its strengths and limitations, and a well-rounded approach that blends search engine marketing and social media can help your business increase reach, establish credibility, and drive sales effectively. Businesses should select the most appropriate online marketing channels based on their goals and continuously adapt to the behavior of their target audience for the best outcomes.\nIf your business needs assistance in planning the right online marketing strategy, consider using a professional\nonline marketing service\nto optimize your campaigns.

Building Brands Through Experience\nIn today’s digital era, consumer choices are abundant, and attention spans are short. Creating tangible, memorable experiences has become a critical strategy for brands to stand out.\nEvent marketing\nis one such powerful tool—enabling brands to showcase their products, services, or values through interactive events. These can take place both offline and online, helping to foster brand recognition, emotional engagement, and long-term loyalty with target audiences.\nWhat Is Event Marketing?\nEvent marketing is the strategic process of planning, managing, and communicating a brand through specifically designed events. The goal is to build brand awareness, strengthen customer engagement, and drive purchase decisions. Ultimately, event marketing aims to develop long-term relationships with customers.\nWhat does event marketing involve? It depends on the brand’s objective. Examples include:\nProduct launches\nTrade shows\nWorkshops or seminars\nExperiential events\nBooth participation at expos or festivals\nSocial media campaigns and competitions\nWhy Is Event Marketing Important?\nTraditional advertising is no longer enough to capture consumer interest. Today’s businesses need to create experiences that resonate. The importance of event marketing lies in its ability to:\nDifferentiate your brand in saturated markets.\nA well-executed event can make a brand memorable and build a distinctive image.\nDrive engagement and emotional connection.\nThoughtfully designed events allow customers to feel part of the brand experience.\nGather valuable audience insights.\nFrom registrations and surveys to behavioral tracking, events provide actionable data on target groups.\nEnable real-time sales opportunities.\nEvents not only encourage purchases during the event but also allow sales teams to engage directly with qualified prospects.\nBuild brand credibility.\nProfessionally run events elevate brand perception and build trust with both new and existing audiences.\nTypes of Event Marketing for Modern Businesses\nModern event marketing is far more than just trade booths and corporate functions. Businesses today can align their events with consumer behavior and current technologies in several ways:\nBrand Activation\nThese are public activities designed to raise awareness and form emotional bonds with the brand. For example, offering product sampling in a shopping mall or hosting an outdoor experience that encourages social media sharing. One of notable event marketing examples is a coffee brand’s “Brew in the Park” event, where customers tasted fresh brews and learned the process hands-on.\nHybrid Events\nThis approach combines offline and online elements, allowing brands to reach a wider audience. For example, a hotel seminar can be livestreamed on Zoom or Facebook Live, with real-time Q&A from online attendees. This type of event marketing removes geographic limits and provides measurable digital data.\nExperience Marketing\nFocused on immersive activities, experience marketing helps participants connect meaningfully with the brand. Examples include product demonstrations set in real-life environments or booths designed with specific themes, like a Japanese cooking station hosted by a condiment brand. These experiences create lasting brand impressions.\nEvent Marketing Examples: Case Studies from Successful Campaigns\nWhen done strategically, event marketing activities can drive tangible results and foster nationwide brand affinity. Below are two government-led examples that highlight success in both sales and brand communication:\nOffline 2 Online Expo\nOne of outstanding event marketing examples is the Offline 2 Online Expo by Thailand’s Department of Business Development. The expo promoted local products nationwide through a series of trade fairs held across five major regions, covering over 2,000 square meters of event space.\nJenosize, the agency responsible for event planning and execution over nine months, applied a blended event marketing strategy—merging on-ground activation with digital engagement.\nResults:\nThis cross-platform strategy attracted thousands from diverse regions, boosting total spending from the initial THB 30 million target to over THB 80 million. The event also showcased the potential of event marketing to uplift local economies and drive real-time sales.\nMinistry of Science Innovation Showcase\nAnother case highlights the use of event marketing to amplify innovation. The Ministry of Science organized an outdoor event in downtown Bangkok to showcase over 100 tech-enhanced products, many requiring live demonstrations to illustrate real-world benefits.\nResults:\nWith Jenosize overseeing event space planning, products like fruit-harvesting tools and agricultural devices had ample room for hands-on interaction. Visitors experienced the products firsthand, improving public perception of Thai innovations and encouraging future business expansion.\nKey Considerations for Effective Event Marketing\nWhile event marketing is a powerful way to create memorable experiences and strong connections, poor execution or overlooked details can hinder success. The following best practices ensure your event marketing activities align with your business goals:\n1. Set Clear Objectives\nDefine a specific goal—whether launching a product, increasing short-term sales, or raising brand awareness. Clear objectives help guide event structure, messaging, and performance tracking.\n2. Choose the Right Venue and Timing\nThe venue should match the audience’s convenience and the event’s purpose. For instance, a product launch may work best in a bustling retail space, while academic sessions fit better in conference halls. Plan early to allow sufficient preparation.\n3. Promote Your Event Widely\nDon’t underestimate pre-event promotion. Use social media, email marketing, online campaigns, or even on-site ads to attract quality attendees and boost participation.\n4. Collect Data and Measure Success\nTrack attendees, engagement levels, and feedback to assess your event's impact. Use these insights to optimize future event marketing strategies, such as adjusting formats or enhancing specific touchpoints.\n5. Prepare for the Unexpected\nEvents are prone to surprises—bad weather, technical glitches, or unexpected crowd sizes. Always have a backup plan and a team trained to adapt swiftly to maintain a high-quality experience.\nEvent marketing is more than organizing an event—it’s a strategic communication tool that builds sustainable brand value. It allows companies to deliver their value proposition directly to the audience in an impactful, human-centric way. In a world where people value meaningful experiences over promotional messaging, a well-planned event marketing strategy can set your brand apart and drive long-term success.\nIf your organization is seeking a trusted partner to design and\nmanage events\nthat truly connect with your target audience,\nJenosize\noffers end-to-end event marketing services tailored to your brand’s goals.

How to Measure Your Brand's Fame\nThese days, brands that aim to succeed can no longer rely solely on advertising. Building brand awareness and owning media space are key to keeping a brand top of mind for customers. This is why\n\"Share of Voice (SOV)\"\nhas become a key metric that marketers worldwide prioritize. If your brand is just a small voice drowned out by the larger competitors, it will be hard for customers to remember and choose you over other brands. Many brands, therefore, choose to collaborate with a specialized\ndigital marketing agency\nto strategize and maximize their SOV effectively.\nWhat is Share of Voice (SOV)?\nShare of Voice (SOV) refers to the proportion of communication your brand has compared to competitors in the market. It calculates how much your brand is present or communicating with consumers through various channels compared to others in the same industry. This can be measured through several communication channels, such as:\nPaid Media:\nThe percentage of your advertising budget spent on paid media compared to competitors in the same industry. Investment in these media channels reflects your brand's ability to reach consumers through paid platforms.\nOwned Media:\nThe number of website visits or engagement on your brand’s social media, such as likes, shares, or comments on your posts. This engagement helps measure how your brand is interacting with and responding to customers.\nEarned Media:\nThe number of articles, reviews, or mentions of your brand in the media or by consumers without any paid promotion. Mentions in the press or reviews from consumers contribute to building credibility and increasing brand recognition in the market.\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Search Visibility:\nThe share of visibility in search engine results, like Google, when people search for terms related to your brand or product. This measure shows how frequently your brand appears in search results compared to competitors in the same industry.\nThe Importance of Share of Voice\nMeasuring Share of Voice (SOV) is not just about gaining an overview of a brand's communication in the market but also holds significance in various aspects that can be applied to improve marketing strategies effectively. These include:\nAssessing the Brand's Market Position\nCalculating SOV helps a brand understand its position relative to competitors. A high SOV means that your brand has better communication and visibility in the market, which reflects the strength of the brand in terms of marketing and creating awareness among the target audience.\nReflecting Growth Opportunities\nStudies have shown that brands with a higher SOV compared to their competitors tend to have greater growth potential in the market. A higher SOV allows brands to increase their market share (Share of Market, or SOM) at a faster rate.\nEnabling More Accurate Marketing Strategy Planning\nHaving clear SOV data allows a brand to plan its marketing strategies more effectively. For instance, analyzing SOV can help a brand decide where to increase its advertising budget or how to adjust its SEO strategy to improve visibility in Google search results. Additionally, it can assist in deciding how to create content or campaigns that generate more engagement from the target audience.\nHow to Calculate Share of Voice\nShare of Voice = (Brand Reach / Total Market Reach) × 100\nFor example, let’s assume Brand A (your brand) competes with Brands B and C in the same market, and you want to calculate the SOV for Brand A in this market.\nData used for calculation:\nBrand A Reach = 50,000 (e.g., website visits, mentions in media and ads)\nBrand B Reach = 40,000\nBrand C Reach = 30,000\nTotal Market Reach = Brand A + Brand B + Brand C = 50,000 + 40,000 + 30,000 = 120,000\nSOV Calculation:\nShare of Voice = (50,000 / 120,000) × 100 = 41.67%\nFrom this calculation, Brand A will have an SOV of 41.67%, meaning your brand has 41.67% of the communication and visibility in the market compared to the two competing brands. This SOV value helps you assess your brand’s position in the market and refine your marketing strategy accordingly.\n﻿\nHow to Increase Share of Voice to Enhance Brand Recognition\nMaximize advertising budget\nInvesting in advertising plays a crucial role in increasing SOV. Strategies like Programmatic Advertising or Targeted Ads help enhance efficiency by reaching specific target groups, reducing advertising costs, and maximizing results. This approach ensures that the brand appears in the right places and attracts more attention.\nCreate high-quality content that appeals to the target audience\nDeveloping high-quality content that resonates with the target audience can significantly boost engagement and brand mentions. For example, creating engaging video content or utilizing influencer marketing to promote the brand can create a larger impact.\nLeverage social media\nSocial media is a powerful tool for increasing SOV. Posting content that aligns with consumer interests, responding to inquiries, and interacting with followers help increase engagement and strengthen the connection between the brand and its audience.\nImprove website ranking in search results using effective SEO techniques\nSEO is another critical strategy to boost SOV. By optimizing website content and using keywords relevant to the target audience, a brand can increase its visibility and ranking in Google search results. Higher visibility leads to increased reach among the target audience.\nEncourage earned media\nEarned media, such as product reviews on blogs, customer experiences shared on social media, or word-of-mouth recommendations, helps create widespread awareness and builds trust in the brand. Encouraging positive mentions through the media or customer experiences can sustainably increase SOV.\nShare of Voice is an important metric for marketing strategies as it helps brands understand their position in the market and serves as a guide to adjust strategies for increasing visibility and market share. Increasing SOV doesn't always mean spending more money, but rather using the right strategies to achieve effective results. This is why many brands choose to consult with an experienced\ndigital marketing agency\nto plan the most cost-effective use of their budget and resources.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Changing consumer behavior has made a retail omnichannel strategy essential for delivering a seamless and superior shopping experience. Whether customers shop in-store, on a website, through an app, or via social media, businesses must integrate all processes and data into a unified platform to provide a consistent and frictionless experience.\nWhat is a Retail Omnichannel Strategy and Why is it Crucial?\nA retail omnichannel strategy refers to the integration of sales, communication, and customer service channels into a cohesive system, ensuring a smooth and unified customer experience across all touchpoints. Whether customers make purchases through online platforms, brick-and-mortar stores, or other digital retail channels, they expect a seamless interaction.\nWith shifting consumer behaviors, relying on a single sales channel is no longer sufficient. Companies that successfully implement an integrated marketing strategy across multiple platforms can maximize sales opportunities and enhance customer loyalty. Additionally, an effective omnichannel approach allows businesses to collect and leverage valuable insights to refine their digital retail and marketing strategies with greater precision.\n5 Key Components of a Successful Retail Omnichannel Strategy\n1. Single Customer Profile: A Centralized Customer Data Hub\nA single customer profile consolidates customer data from all channels, enabling businesses to gain deep insights into individual behaviors and preferences. By analyzing data from online stores, mobile apps, social media, and other sales touchpoints, companies can optimize their integrated marketing strategy and tailor their digital retail approach to different customer segments.\n2. Omnichannel Management: Seamless Cross-Channel Integration\nOmnichannel management ensures that all sales and service channels work together cohesively. This allows customers to shop, return products, or access post-purchase services through any channel without hassle. A prime example is the Click & Collect system, where customers can place orders online and pick them up at their preferred store location.\n3. Commercial Solutions: Enhancing Operational Efficiency\nDeveloping robust commercial solutions enables businesses to efficiently manage inventory, pricing, promotions, and payments. This includes real-time Point of Sale (POS) systems that synchronize data across channels or AI-powered recommendation engines that provide personalized product suggestions for each customer.\n4. Personalized Marketing & Engagement\nPersonalized marketing leverages behavioral data and AI to create targeted content, promotions, and offers tailored to each customer’s preferences. Examples include sending exclusive discount coupons via mobile apps or recommending products through email campaigns based on a customer's shopping history.\n5. Logistics & Fulfillment Optimization\nA well-optimized logistics and fulfillment system ensures fast and accurate order deliveries. Technologies enhancing this process include automated warehouse management systems (WMS), real-time order tracking, and route optimization analytics to speed up deliveries and reduce shipping costs.\nLeveraging Advanced Technology in a Retail Omnichannel Strategy\nData Hub & Business Intelligence\nA data hub consolidates information from all platforms, allowing businesses to analyze customer behavior more accurately. These insights can be used to forecast sales, refine marketing strategies, and improve supply chain efficiency.\nCustomer Data Platform (CDP) & Personalize Engine\nA Customer Data Platform (CDP) organizes and manages customer data from various sources, while a personalization engine customizes experiences by offering relevant product recommendations and exclusive deals tailored to individual customer needs.\nSuper App & LINE OA Management\nSuper apps and LINE Official Accounts (LINE OA) are powerful tools for building a comprehensive digital retail ecosystem. These platforms integrate payment solutions, product ordering, and customer service within a single interface, enhancing convenience and customer engagement.\nCase Study: 7App by 7-Eleven – Bridging the Gap Between Digital and Physical Retail\nA standout example of an effective omnichannel strategy is\n“7App by 7-Eleven”\n, which seamlessly connects online and offline customer experiences:\n7App:\nAllows customers to check promotions, earn and redeem rewards, and purchase products via a mobile application.\n7Delivery:\nEnables doorstep delivery from local 7-Eleven stores, catering to the modern consumer’s need for convenience.\nPhygital Experience:\nIntegrates digital and physical\nretail, such as using online coupons for in-store purchases or ordering through the app and picking up in-store.\nSeamlessly integrating sales, communication, and customer service channels through advanced technology not only enhances customer satisfaction but also improves operational efficiency, reduces costs, and strengthens long-term competitive advantages. Businesses looking to implement or enhance their omnichannel strategy should consider partnering with experts in\ndigital transformation\nand integrated marketing strategy development to create a digital ecosystem tailored to their business model and target audience.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Discover 3 Platforms for Brands\nSelling products online is now a crucial strategy for businesses looking to expand their market and reach customers more effectively. If you're wondering what are the sales channels available today, the three main platforms—\nMarketplaces, Brand.com sites, and Social Commerce\n—are gaining immense popularity among SMEs and retailers.\nHowever, selecting the right platform significantly impacts your sales performance and business growth. Let’s dive into the advantages and limitations of each channel, and explore some helpful tips to decide where to sell products most effectively.\nMarketplace: A Sales Channel with a Large Customer Base\nAdvantages of Selling Through a Marketplace\nAccess to a Large Customer Base Quickly\nMarketplaces offer a vast and geographically diverse customer base, enabling businesses to reach potential buyers faster. Selling on these platforms can drastically cut down the time needed to build a new customer base. Marketplaces also provide built-in support systems like online payments, shipping logistics, and customer service.\nReady-to-Use Infrastructure\nWith ready-made systems for payments, shipping, and after-sales service, sellers don't need to invest in technology development or backend management. This allows businesses to start selling immediately.\nConsumer Trust Through Reviews and Product Guarantees\nBuyers often trust marketplaces that offer customer reviews and product guarantees. This credibility can help boost trust in your brand and drive sales.\nPromotions and Campaigns to Attract Shoppers\nFrequent sales campaigns like flash sales and discount coupons make it easier for businesses to boost sales without creating promotions from scratch.\nLimitations of Selling Through a Marketplace\nHigh Competition\nBecause many sellers don't fully understand what are the distribution channels available and immediately turn to marketplaces, competition is fierce—especially on price. Businesses often need to offer discounts or incentives, which can reduce profit margins.\nSales and Advertising Fees\nMarketplaces typically charge commission fees on each sale and additional fees for advertising, which can eat into your profits.\nLimited Control Over the Customer Experience and Branding\nSelling through a marketplace limits your ability to control the customer journey or build a distinctive brand identity, as most of the experience is dictated by the platform’s structure.\nBrand.com: Your Own Branded Online Store\nAdvantages of Selling Through Brand.com\nFull Ownership of Your Brand\nRunning your own website gives you complete control over design, product presentation, and the customer experience.\nCustomer Data Collection for CRM\nSelling via Brand.com allows businesses to collect valuable customer data and use it to develop effective Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategies, fostering long-term loyalty.\nNo Platform Commission Fees\nBy selling directly through your own website, you avoid platform fees and can maximize your profit margins.\nEnhanced Credibility and Brand Image\nHaving your own well-designed website strengthens your brand’s credibility and supports long-term business growth.\nLimitations of Selling Through Brand.com\nInitial Investment in Website Development\nBuilding a professional website requires investment in design, payment processing systems, stock management, and backend operations.\nMarketing Efforts Needed to Drive Traffic\nUnlike marketplaces that naturally attract visitors, Brand.com sites require strong marketing strategies to bring in customers.\nMore Complex Operations\nManaging your own e-commerce site means handling payments, logistics, and customer service on your own, making operations more complex compared to marketplaces.\nSocial Commerce: Direct Sales Channels to Engage Customers\nAdvantages of Selling Through Social Commerce\nDirect Communication and Interaction With Customers\nSocial Commerce platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LINE OA, and TikTok allow businesses to engage directly with customers, building stronger relationships and trust.\nFull Control Over Brand and Sales Strategy\nSocial Commerce empowers businesses to manage all aspects of product presentation, content creation, and promotions, making it easier to fine-tune strategies based on target audiences.\nLower Costs Compared to Marketplaces\nSocial Commerce platforms generally have lower fees, allowing sellers to leverage organic reach and minimize advertising costs.\nHigher Conversion Through Live and Chat Commerce\nLive streaming and chat interactions enhance the buying experience, offering personalized and immediate responses that boost conversion rates.\nLimitations of Selling Through Social Commerce\nSelf-Management of All Processes\nSellers are responsible for managing payments, shipping, and customer service independently.\nConstant Algorithm Changes\nSocial media algorithms change frequently, potentially reducing customer reach without additional advertising investment.\nNo Automated Stock Management\nUnlike marketplaces, inventory must be manually updated, requiring accuracy and attention to detail.\nUnsure Where to Sell Products? Social Commerce Might Be Your Best Bet\nWhile marketplaces offer a large, ready-made customer base and robust support systems, Social Commerce is rapidly emerging as an attractive option—especially in countries like Thailand, where consumers spend a lot of time on social media.\nStrategies for Successful Social Commerce Selling\nCreate Engaging Content\nHigh-quality content like product review videos, live streams, and influencer collaborations can significantly boost visibility and customer interest.\nUse Chat Commerce for Real-Time Customer Support\nAnswering customer inquiries through chat builds confidence and makes it easier for customers to make a purchase decision.\nTargeted Ads on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok\nAdvertising should be carefully targeted to your ideal customer groups to maximize reach and conversion rates.\nUse Management Tools to Boost Efficiency\nSupporting tools like LINE OA, chatbots, and CRM systems help streamline sales management and enhance customer service.\nNow that you understand what are the sales channels, it’s clear that selecting the right online sales platform depends on your business’s objectives and resources.\nMarketplace is ideal for businesses aiming to access a broad customer base quickly, supported by ready-to-use systems.\nBrand.com is perfect for businesses wanting full control, enhanced credibility, and stronger branding over the long term.\nSocial Commerce is one of the best channels to sell products for businesses that want to control their brand narrative, build direct customer relationships, and minimize platform fees.\nFor businesses aiming for sustainable growth, Social Commerce is a highly potential option. Implementing the right strategies can help businesses build a stable customer base and achieve long-term sales growth. Additionally, utilizing\ntech solutions\ncan further support the development of websites and systems that effectively meet customer needs and enhance operational efficiency.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

This is especially true for government agencies, which must adapt quickly to meet citizens’ expectations and align with the\n“Thailand 5.0”\npolicy focused on advancing the country toward a digital economy and society. Therefore, the transition to a digital government is a significant step that will truly transform how government operations and public services are delivered.\nThe Electronic Government Act: The Starting Point of Change\nThe Electronic Government Act is a key driver pushing all government agencies to seriously upgrade their work processes to digital standards. This includes document handling, service delivery, internal coordination, and communication with citizens. The act targets four main objectives: convenience, speed, transparency, and service efficiency.\nHowever, this transition has not been smooth due to the government’s long-standing reliance on paper-based systems. The challenge lies in restructuring organizations, workflows, and internal culture to effectively embrace new technologies—requiring careful planning and continuous development.\nWhat Are the 6 Components of Government Work in the Digital Transformation Era?\nTo ensure an efficient transition to digital systems, six key components must work in harmony:\n1. Establishing a Strong Data Governance Foundation\nSystematic data management is the heart of modern government operations. Agencies must define clear guidelines for data storage, usage, sharing, and security standards across the organization to build trust and ensure data accuracy.\n2. Full Digitization of Work Processes\nConverting documents from paper to digital format is just the first step. More importantly, workflows must be fully adapted to digital systems—from submitting applications electronically to real-time approval and tracking.\n3. Integration of Data Across Agencies\nA major problem in public service is siloed operations. Connecting data between agencies is key to reducing redundancies, improving efficiency, and delivering seamless services to citizens.\n4. One-Stop Service\nConsolidating services from multiple agencies into a single access point makes it easier for citizens to reach services, both online and offline. This elevates the public service experience to meet the expectations of the digital age.\n5. Open Government Data for Transparency\nMaking government data publicly available in accessible, usable formats increases operational transparency, builds citizen trust, and can spur innovation—especially for SMEs seeking deep insights to develop their businesses.\n6. Developing Digital Skills for Government Personnel\nSustainable digital transformation is impossible without a digitally skilled workforce. Government agencies must invest in training, skill development, and mindset shifts so officials can use technology flexibly and confidently.\nChallenges for Government Organizations in Adopting Digital Transformation\nTransitioning fully to digital government operations offers opportunities to improve service quality and reduce long-term costs in time and resources. However, significant challenges remain, such as:\nData Security and Cybersecurity\nIn an era where data is a critical asset, investing in cybersecurity is essential to protect citizens’ personal information and build trust in government electronic systems.\nOrganizational and Personnel Adaptation\nMany agencies remain tied to traditional workflows. Successful digital transformation requires open-minded leadership that promotes change and fosters a culture that embraces learning and adaptation.\nInvestment in Technology and Infrastructure\nDigital transformation demands appropriate investment. Governments must allocate budgets to develop digital infrastructure and select technologies that meet long-term operational needs.\nDigital Transformation Examples of Businesses Government Should Study\nLINE MAN Wongnai\nAs one of Thailand’s largest food delivery platforms, LINE MAN Wongnai integrates digital systems with logistics and customer service. Leveraging data and technology enhances the accuracy of order management and delivery, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.\nPTT Public Company Limited\nPTT has developed energy infrastructure using IoT and Big Data technology to monitor and control gas and oil pipeline systems. This improves resource management efficiency, prevents damage, and enhances operational safety.\nIn conclusion, the transition to digital transformation in the public sector is a complex process requiring comprehensive planning. By applying digital technology at every step—from building data foundations to developing personal skills—government agencies can improve efficiency, transparency, and create public services that better meet citizen needs.\n﻿\nFor government organizations ready to confidently embrace new ways of working, choosing a technology partner with expertise is critical.\nJenosize\n, a\ntech agency\nexperienced in technology solutions, is ready to design and develop digital systems tailored to your organization’s specific needs.

For SMEs and public sector organizations in Thailand,\ndigital transformation\nand AI transformation have become key factors in enabling a more responsive and efficient service delivery to citizens and businesses.\nWhy is Government Digital Strategy Essential for Digital Transformation?\nEnhancing Service Efficiency\nDigital systems allow government organizations to streamline complex procedures, reduce paper usage, and decrease the time required to deliver services to the public and businesses. By leveraging government technology solutions like automation systems and\nartificial intelligence (AI)\n, organizations can provide faster and more accurate services, meeting the demands of citizens and entrepreneurs promptly.\nPromoting Transparency and Accountability\nA digital government transformation platform provides greater public access to government data, reducing the complexity of paperwork processes and increasing traceability through digital systems like Open Data or Blockchain. These technologies prevent document fraud and build trust between the government and the public, enhancing transparency and accountability.\nStimulating the Digital Economy\nThe government digital strategy supports the growth of SMEs and startups by granting them access to digital infrastructure, such as e-Government systems and e-Procurement, as well as digital business platforms. Additionally, policies encouraging government technology usage—such as online licensing, digital transactions, and tax incentives—enhance the competitiveness of Thai entrepreneurs in the global market.\n6 Digital Strategies for Public Sector Organizations\n1. Digital Infrastructure: Essential Building Blocks\nThe development of digital infrastructure, including 5G networks, cloud computing, and data centers, is a critical factor for government agencies to operate effectively. A robust infrastructure enables seamless data sharing between departments, reduces redundancy, and enhances service delivery capabilities to the public and businesses.\n2. Government Digital Transformation การเปลี่ยนผ่านสู่การบริหารจัดการภาครัฐยุคใหม่\nPublic sector organizations must adapt to digital operations by utilizing government technology solutions like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems and Big Data Analytics. This transition not only increases operational speed but also reduces costs and enhances the flexibility of service delivery.\n3. Digital Identity & e-Government: Elevating Service Delivery\nImplementing digital identity systems, such as digital national ID cards, improves public access to government services by simplifying identity verification and reducing document fraud. Moreover, the development of comprehensive e-Government strategies, covering all sectors, makes government operations more organized and efficient.\n4. Government AI Transformation: Revolutionizing Public Sector Operations with AI\nIn addition to its widespread use in the private sector, AI plays a crucial role in improving government processes. For instance, AI-driven chatbots provide public information services, machine learning systems assist in data analysis for policy decision-making, and AI predicts social issues, allowing government agencies to manage resources effectively.\n5. Cybersecurity & Data Protection: Ensuring Government Digital Security\nProtecting government data and systems from cyber threats is paramount. Governments must focus on developing cybersecurity frameworks, encrypting sensitive data, and establishing cybersecurity operations centers to handle risks and ensure public data security.\n6. Public-Private Collaboration: Leveraging Partnerships for Effective Transformation\nBuilding collaborations between the public and private sectors is essential for effective digital transformation in government. Encouraging private sector participation in government digital projects—such as developing apps for public services or involving startups and SMEs in innovation initiatives—ensures that government operations effectively meet the needs of both the public and businesses.\nDeveloping a government digital strategy is at the heart of modernizing public administration. Not only does it enhance operational efficiency, but it also opens opportunities for SMEs and organizations to integrate into the digital economy securely. If your organization seeks guidance on developing and implementing a digital strategy effectively, consulting with\ndigital consulting\nexperts is a crucial first step toward driving success in today’s digital era.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

When applied correctly, Big Data can transform government agencies from service providers into value-creating and profit-generating organizations.\nTo stay competitive in the digital age, it is crucial for government organizations to understand how to fully leverage Big Data for the government sector to optimize operations, boost revenue, and mitigate risks.\nUsing Big Data in the Government Sector to Enhance Operational Efficiency\nOne of the most important advantages of Big Data in the government sector is its ability to improve operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making across various functions, including:\nAnalyzing Citizen Behavior\nBy collecting and analyzing citizen data, government organizations can gain deeper insights into the needs and challenges of the public. This understanding enables the design of public policies that better match real-world conditions. For instance, analyzing citizens' travel patterns can help allocate transportation resources more effectively, reduce traffic congestion, and improve commuting experiences.\nImplementing AI and Machine Learning for Electronic Document Management\nLeveraging AI and Machine Learning allows government organizations to streamline electronic document management. These technologies help verify information, organize data, and automate document handling processes, reducing human error and simplifying complex workflows — ultimately increasing operational efficiency.\nPredictive Analytics\nPredictive Analytics empowers government agencies to anticipate future trends and citizen demands. For example, forecasting the number of patients requiring public healthcare services enables more accurate resource allocation, preventing potential bottlenecks before they occur.\nUsing Big Data for the Government Sector to Drive Revenue and Economic Opportunities\nThe effective use of Big Data for government sector can generate significant new economic opportunities, promoting national economic growth through:\nDeveloping Open Data Platforms\nPublishing accessible Open Data for the business sector fosters innovation and the development of new solutions that stimulate the economy. Transportation data, real estate information, or consumer behavior insights can empower private companies to develop technologies tailored to market demands, creating additional value for the economy.\nAdvancing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)\nCollaboration between the public and private sectors through shared data initiatives — such as smart city projects or digital infrastructure programs — can lead to the creation of services and infrastructures that better meet citizen needs and promote sustainable economic development.\nConducting In-Depth Data Analysis to Support SMEs and Small Businesses\nDeep data analysis provides small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with strategic planning tools. Insights can inform marketing strategies, inventory management, and financial planning, helping SMEs maintain competitiveness and achieve long-term success.\nUsing Big Data for Government Organizations to Reduce Risk and Prevent Fraud\nBeyond operational and economic benefits, Big Data for government organizations also plays a crucial role in minimizing risks and preventing corruption within public administration, through initiatives such as:\nReal-Time Financial Transaction Monitoring\nReal-time monitoring of financial transactions can detect irregularities such as money laundering, overspending, or procurement fraud, safeguarding public funds.\nLeveraging Blockchain Technology to Enhance Transparency\nUsing\nblockchain\ncreates transparent, auditable systems that reduce opportunities for corruption, particularly in procurement and financial transaction processes, thus improving trust and operational integrity.\nAnalyzing Anomalous Behavior to Detect Fraud\nBy analyzing unusual behavior patterns, Big Data helps identify fraud or misconduct within government procurement processes, signaling potential issues before they escalate.\nChallenges and Solutions for Implementing Big Data in the Government Sector\nDespite its advantages, implementing Big Data in the government sector comes with several challenges, including:\nIT Infrastructure and Skilled Personnel\nStrong IT infrastructure and skilled data analysts are essential for government organizations to fully capitalize on Big Data initiatives.\nData Privacy Laws and Policies\nClear data protection laws and policies foster public trust, encouraging citizens to share data while minimizing the risk of privacy violations.\nEstablishing Data Exchange Standards Between Government and Private Sectors\nDeveloping unified standards for data exchange between public and private sectors is critical for promoting collaboration and maximizing the benefits of Big Data.\nBy strategically implementing Big Data, government organizations can enhance operational efficiency, lower costs, promote economic development, and combat corruption. When properly managed, Big Data for government organizations becomes a vital tool for creating sustainable economic value and public service innovation.\nAdditionally, partnering with expert\npublic sector consulting services\nspecializing in data analysis and management can further support successful Big Data initiatives.

A loyalty program offers incentives and special privileges to promote repeat purchases. However, knowing how to create a loyalty program that succeeds goes beyond offering simple rewards. It requires thoughtful design that considers customer behavior, motivation, and ease of use, creating memorable experiences that drive true brand loyalty over time.\nWhat Is a Loyalty Program and Why Is It Important?\nA loyalty program is a marketing strategy designed to reward customers for their repeat purchases.\nThe main goal is to retain existing customers, increase purchase frequency, and maximize customer lifetime value (CLV). In addition to boosting sales, loyalty programs help strengthen the relationship between customers and brands, fostering deeper emotional connections that encourage long-term loyalty.\nBenefits of a Loyalty Program for Businesses\nIncreases Repeat Purchases\nA well-designed loyalty program incentivizes customers to return by offering valuable rewards such as points that can be redeemed for discounts, gifts, or exclusive deals.\nStrengthens Long-Term Relationships\nPoint-based systems make customers feel like valued \"members\" of the brand community, deepening their emotional connection and increasing the likelihood of ongoing support.\nCreates Competitive Differentiation\nIn crowded markets, a standout loyalty program can give a brand a competitive edge by delivering superior value and memorable experiences.\nEncourages Word-of-Mouth Referrals\nSatisfied customers who enjoy collecting points and receiving rewards are more likely to recommend the brand to others, either through personal referrals or social media, naturally boosting brand awareness.\nPopular Types of Loyalty Programs\n1. Point-Based Loyalty Program\nCustomers earn points with every purchase or designated action, which can later be redeemed for rewards such as discounts, gifts, or special privileges.\n2. Tiered Loyalty Program\nThis system categorizes customers into tiers based on cumulative spending (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum). Higher-tier members receive greater benefits, motivating customers to climb the loyalty ladder.\n3. Cashback Loyalty Program\nCustomers receive a percentage of their spending back as credit or cash, offering a tangible incentive to keep making purchases.\n4. Subscription-Based Loyalty Program\nCustomers pay a monthly or annual subscription fee to access special benefits like permanent discounts, early product access, or exclusive services.\n5. Gamification Loyalty Program\nIntegrating game mechanics like unlocking levels, collecting coins, or completing challenges makes earning rewards more engaging and interactive, increasing customer participation.\nHow to Create a Loyalty Program That Succeeds\n1. Align the Program with Business Strategy\nThe goals of the loyalty program must be clearly defined, such as increasing repeat purchases within three months or raising the average basket size per transaction.\n2. Offer Meaningful Rewards\nRewards should provide either high emotional or economic value, such as exclusive gifts, member-only discounts, or access to VIP events not available to the general public.\n3. Ensure Ease of Use\nRegistration, point collection, and reward redemption should be simple and streamlined, preferably accessible through online platforms like apps, websites, or digital membership cards.\n4. Communicate Effectively and Consistently\nRegularly update customers about their point balance, new rewards, or special promotions via multiple channels, including email, SMS, or social media, to maintain engagement.\n5. Use Customer Behavior Data for Optimization\nAnalyzing customer spending patterns, interests, and behaviors allows businesses to personalize the loyalty program, offering rewards that align closely with individual preferences.\nExamples of Successful Loyalty Programs\nStarbucks Rewards\nStarbucks’ rewards program allows customers to collect stars and redeem them for free drinks and special treats. Members also enjoy exclusive perks like mobile order-ahead and a free birthday beverage.\nSephora Beauty Insider\nSephora’s tiered membership system offers different rewards based on spending levels, including exclusive promotions and gifts for top-tier members.\nThe 1 Card (Central Group)\nOne of Thailand’s most comprehensive loyalty programs, The 1 Card allows customers to collect and redeem points across a wide range of Central Group brands, offering both flexibility and convenience.\nA loyalty program is a highly effective marketing tool for building long-term customer relationships and increasing repeat business. To maximize impact, businesses should select the type of loyalty system that best fits their target audience, design an easy-to-use platform, and offer attractive rewards that truly motivate customers to stay engaged. Consistently tracking and analyzing customer behavior will help further refine and optimize the program, contributing to sustainable business growth over time.\nFor brands looking to elevate their loyalty initiatives, partnering with a\ntech solution company\nspecializing in membership systems and customer data management can be a strategic move to enhance customer experiences and achieve long-term success.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nSuper App vs Regular App: Which Should Organizations Choose?\nDesign\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n193\n0\nSuper App or Regular App: Which Is the Key to Growth?\nEntrepreneurs across industries are increasingly aware that the super app trend is gaining momentum, particularly in Asian markets where platforms like WeChat, Grab, and LINE have become essential to consumers' daily lives. At the same time, many businesses still rely on conventional apps to deliver specific, targeted services. This raises a critical question: Should businesses use a super app or a traditional app to drive success?\nWhat is a Super App and Why Should Large Enterprises Pay Attention?\nA super app is a platform that integrates a wide variety of services into a single application. Users can access different functions—such as messaging, payment, food delivery, and transportation—without switching between apps.\nOne of clear examples of super apps is WeChat in Asia, which started as a simple chat app and evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem.\nKey advantages of super apps for large enterprises include:\nMulti-channel customer engagement\nthrough a single app, enhancing accessibility and providing a seamless user experience.\nSupport for multiple services within a unified system\n, reducing fragmentation and simplifying internal operations.\nComplete ecosystem development\n, enabling better CRM, personalization, and data analytics to deepen customer insights.\nKey Differences Between a Super App and a Traditional App\nChoosing the right platform depends on an organization’s needs and capabilities. The table below summarizes the main differences between a super app and a traditional app:\nHow a Super App Enhances Organizational Operations\nConsolidates Key Services Into a Single Platform\nOne major benefit of having a super app is the ability to integrate essential organizational services into one platform, such as:\nHuman Resource Management (HRM)\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)\nE-commerce platforms for product and service sales\nLoyalty programs to foster and maintain customer loyalty\nBy consolidating these systems, businesses can reduce operational complexity, improve workflow efficiency, and provide both employees and customers faster access to necessary services—all while building a strong foundation for future service expansion without starting from scratch.\nEnables Efficient Management of Large-Scale Customer Data\nUtilizing a super app allows organizations to manage customer data in a structured, secure, and centralized manner. With all data housed in a centralized system, businesses can perform highly effective data analysis.\nThese deeper insights enable precise personalization strategies, such as:\nRecommending customized products and services\nOffering targeted promotions\nDesigning unique customer experiences\nThis strengthens long-term customer relationships and maximizes profitability opportunities.\nReduces Dependence on External Systems\nInvesting in a super app empowers organizations to control their infrastructure and data without relying heavily on third-party solutions. Having full ownership over the system enhances an enterprise’s ability to execute full-scale digital transformation.\nBusinesses can develop, adjust, or improve services based on strategic plans without waiting for external providers’ approvals or facing their limitations.\nAdditionally, reduced reliance on outside systems enhances data security and minimizes operational risks tied to external service providers.\nAccelerates Innovation and New Feature Deployment\nA super app enables organizations to test and launch new features more quickly due to the platform's flexible architecture. New services—such as online booking tools, innovative payment methods, or exclusive membership systems—can be introduced without disrupting the core platform.\nMoreover, with a shared user base within a single platform, gathering feedback and analyzing real-time usage becomes easier, allowing businesses to continuously innovate and respond to market demands quickly.\nEnhances Omnichannel Capabilities\nSuper apps are specifically designed to support true omnichannel experiences, seamlessly connecting services across apps, websites, offline branches, and various social media platforms.\nSmooth data integration across channels allows customers to start a transaction in one channel and complete it in another without disruption. Organizations can thus deliver consistent, personalized customer experiences—critical for building a competitive advantage in today's market.\nCase Study: Examples of Super Apps That Found Success in Asia\nWeChat\nWeChat stands as one of the most successful examples of a super app worldwide. It started in 2011 as a basic chat application and quickly expanded to cover nearly every aspect of daily life for users in China.\nToday, WeChat is not just a communication tool but a lifestyle hub offering:\nMessaging, voice calls, and video calls\nMoney transfers and payments via WeChat Pay\nFood ordering, ride-hailing, and online shopping\nAccess to government services such as hospital appointment booking, license renewals, and official document submissions\nWeChat’s strength lies in seamlessly integrating various services into a single platform, creating a massive ecosystem where users rarely need to exit the app. This integration has made WeChat a driving force in China's digital economy.\nGrab\nGrab initially launched in Malaysia in 2012 as a ride-hailing app but quickly expanded throughout Southeast Asia, evolving into a super app that meets the needs of modern urban living.\nGrab's current services include:\nCar and motorcycle ride-hailing\nFood delivery (GrabFood) and package delivery (GrabExpress)\nPayment systems and e-wallets (GrabPay)\nFinancial services, including microloans, insurance, and investment options (Grab Financial Group)\nGrab has successfully created a cohesive ecosystem that encourages cross-service usage, increasing revenue streams from its existing user base and serving as a leading example of a super app driving digital innovation in the region.\nLINE\nLINE began as a popular chat application in Japan before expanding its capabilities to become a super app that integrates a wide range of services, including communication, finance, and marketing. Today, key services within the LINE platform include:\nChat, voice calls, and video calls\nMoney transfers and payments via LINE Pay\nAdditional financial services such as LINE BK (online banking) and LINE MAN (food delivery and lifestyle services in Thailand)\nLINE Official Account for businesses to create marketing channels and CRM with customers\nLINE Shopping and LINE Ads Platform, which help expand business opportunities for all types of entrepreneurs\nLINE's success reflects the power of deeply understanding user behavior in each country and developing a platform that caters to both personal and business needs simultaneously.\nFor businesses seeking flexibility, customer base expansion, and reduced development costs, building a super app is an ideal solution—especially for enterprises aiming to reach a wide range of consumers and build an ecosystem that supports long-term growth.\nHowever, deciding between a super app and a regular application depends on each business’s goals and strategy. In an era where technology advances rapidly and data has become a valuable asset, many organizations are now turning to\ndigital transformation service\nproviders to design scalable, flexible digital systems—laying the foundation for future Super-app development. This presents a key opportunity that no organization should overlook.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Tech That Includes Everyone\nAmid the rapid and unprecedented evolution of digital technology, the word “digital” has become foundational to how we live, work, and grow national economies. But while many groups are moving forward with confidence, a significant portion of the population is being left behind—simply because they lack access to technology-driven opportunities.\nSo how can we ensure that everyone moves forward together, equitably? That’s the core principle of digital inclusion: creating a truly inclusive digital society for all.\nWhat Is Digital Inclusion?\nDigital Inclusion refers to ensuring that everyone in society can access, use, and benefit from digital technology equally—regardless of gender, age, income, geography, or physical ability.\nThe concept focuses on empowering every group to engage in society and personal development through technology. It includes three main components:\nAccess to infrastructure, such as high-speed internet and digital devices\nDigital literacy, to ensure safe and productive use of technology\nInclusive design, to make technology accessible for people with disabilities or special needs\nWhy Is Digital Inclusion Important for Businesses?\nFor organizations of all types—especially SMEs and retailers—digital inclusion is more than just a social responsibility. It’s a proactive strategy that drives holistic business growth.\nReducing Opportunity Gaps\nDigital inclusion allows underserved populations—like daily wage workers, the elderly, or persons with disabilities—to participate in the digital economy. It also opens doors for small business partners to enter digital systems more easily.\nEnhancing Customer Experience\nBy designing accessible UX/UI for seniors, people with disabilities, or those with language barriers, companies can improve satisfaction and usability across diverse customer segments.\nImproving Operational Efficiency\nWhen all employees are confident in using technology, it enhances communication and productivity at every level.\nSupporting a Sustainable Digital Economy\nBusinesses that embrace technology for all are laying the groundwork for long-term growth—expanding revenue streams, customer bases, and cross-sector collaboration.\nKey Components of Digital Inclusion\n1. Infrastructure Access (Connectivity)\nWidespread internet coverage and access to digital devices—smartphones, tablets, or computers—especially in rural or low-income areas, are foundational to digital inclusion.\n2. Digital Skills and Literacy\nThis includes the ability to use technology effectively, recognize online risks like scams, and create or solve problems using digital tools.\n3. Inclusive Design\nTo truly offer technology for all, platforms must be designed with accessibility in mind—using large fonts, high-contrast colors, voice captions, and support for local dialects or assistive devices.\n4. Public and Private Sector Support\nGovernment and corporate initiatives—such as affordable internet, training programs, and inclusive digital platforms—are vital to achieving digital equality across all communities.\nHow Organizations Can Embrace Digital Inclusion\n﻿If your organization wants to promote technology for all, here are four actionable steps to get started:\nUnderstand Your Audience Holistically\nBeyond age, gender, and income, consider factors like digital skill levels, language, cultural context, and physical limitations to truly meet your audience’s needs.\nUse Clear and Inclusive Language\nCommunicate in plain, jargon-free language. Offer multilingual content to support users from diverse backgrounds.\nInvest in Digital Training and Support\nDevelop both internal and external human capital—through employee training or online courses for customers.\nEvaluate Inclusivity and Gather User Feedback\nProvide channels for users to offer feedback and be part of the development process, ensuring your tech solutions genuinely support digital equality.\nCase Study: Businesses Implementing Technology for All\nUnilever’s “Shakti” Project in India\nUnilever trained women in rural areas to become micro-entrepreneurs using digital tools. They gained access to purchasing systems, supplier communications, and online marketing, helping expand rural markets and improve community livelihoods.\nGrab’s GrabMerchant and Digital Literacy Program\nGrab helped small merchants join its platform by providing not just store management tools, but also training in basic skills—like product photography, pricing strategies, and app-based customer communication.\nGood Technology Should Leave No One Behind\nDigital Inclusion isn’t just about digital equality—it’s a critical tool for building a sustainable digital society. SMEs, retail businesses, and public institutions that prioritize widespread access to technology are best positioned to unlock new opportunities, expand their customer base, and meet public needs in a fast-evolving digital landscape.\nAt\nJenosize\n, we’re a\ntech agency\nthat specializes in digital system design and user experience.

    "content": "<\nBack\nWhat Is Low Code and No Code? Key Differences Explained\nTechnology\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n15\n0\nWhat Is Low-Code/No-Code? Build Apps Without Writing Code!\nIn today’s digital age, where technology plays a pivotal role in every sector of the economy, the ability to rapidly develop applications and digital solutions has become a crucial factor in determining an organization’s competitiveness. Whether it’s SMEs, retail businesses, or even government agencies looking to improve public services, one of the most effective technologies meeting these demands is the low code platform and no code platform—both of which are gaining widespread popularity around the world.\nWhat Is Low Code?\nLow code refers to a low code platform that enables users to develop applications or business systems with minimal coding—sometimes none at all. Users can design workflows, databases, and user interfaces using intuitive drag-and-drop tools.\nThe strength of low code lies in its balance between ease of use and customization capabilities. While it is beginner-friendly, it still allows those with coding experience to extend and tailor the application as needed. This makes it a great choice for organizations that require flexibility and already have some level of developer resources in-house.\nWhat Is a No Code Platform?\nA no code platform takes it a step further, enabling users to build applications without writing a single line of code. It’s designed to empower non-technical staff—such as marketing teams, operations staff, or internal department personnel—to create systems using pre-built templates and ready-to-use features.\nThe major benefit of a no code platform is that it reduces the workload on IT departments and encourages the rise of citizen developers, allowing employees outside of IT to actively participate in digital transformation.\nComparison Table: Low Code vs. No Code Platform\nBusiness and Organizational Benefits of Low Code and No Code Platforms\nReduced development time and cost:\nCut down on the need to hire full development teams and minimize coding and testing time.\nAccelerates digital transformation:\nFacilitates smooth transitions into digital systems, especially for organizations with limited tech infrastructure.\nEnhances operational agility:\nEnables frequent iteration, testing, and improvements without complex development cycles.\nAlleviates IT workload:\nAllows IT teams to focus on complex systems while other departments manage simpler applications independently.\nIdeal for resource-constrained organizations:\nParticularly beneficial for SMEs that need tailored systems without significant investment in IT infrastructure.\nReal-World Use Cases in Business and Government\nRetail Businesses\nIn retail, where data management is constant and ever-changing, implementing a low code or no code platform enables companies to efficiently build stock management systems. Features may include real-time inventory updates, low stock alerts, or automated promotional campaigns based on customer behavior. Businesses can also collect and analyze customer data—like purchase history and site visits—for personalized marketing without relying on large development teams or expensive software agencies.\nSMEs\nSmall businesses often face limitations in budget, time, and technical personnel. With low code and no code platforms, SMEs can build web applications tailored to their operations—such as online order systems connected to social commerce, sales tracking dashboards, or basic CRM tools. These systems can be launched in just days and easily adjusted as the business grows.\nGovernment Agencies\nMany government agencies are turning to low code and no code platforms to enhance public services. Examples include online request forms for government documents, feedback systems for public policies, and project tracking dashboards—all without requiring citizens to visit an office. These platforms enable data collection and transparency while allowing internal staff with no coding background to manage the systems.\nCautions When Using Low Code and No Code Platforms\nWhile these platforms offer many advantages, organizations should be aware of certain risks:\nSecurity and compliance limitations:\nNot all platforms meet enterprise-level security standards or comply with industry-specific regulations.\nVendor lock-in:\nRelying on a single provider may lead to difficulties and high costs when migrating or scaling in the future.\nQuality control:\nAllowing non-technical staff to develop systems can lead to UX/UI flaws or poorly structured data.\nLow code platforms and no code platforms are transforming how organizations of all sizes approach application development. They are not just IT tools—they are enablers of innovation across departments, delivering faster, more cost-effective, and more adaptive solutions in today’s digital-first world.\nWhen used strategically, these technologies can be a powerful competitive advantage—enabling flexibility, differentiation, and sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving market.\nIf your organization is looking for a\ndigital transformation service\nwith a scalable and future-proof technology foundation,\nJenosize\nis ready to be your trusted digital partner.

Reimagining Thailand’s Urban Future\nAmid global disruptions—from pandemics and climate volatility to rapidly shifting consumer behavior—governments around the world are laying the foundation for smart cities that respond to these challenges systematically. Thailand is no exception. The digital transformation of the public sector is no longer optional—it’s essential to keeping government services relevant and responsive to the evolving needs of modern citizens.\nThe smart city concept\nis a powerful mechanism that enables Thailand to transition from traditional bureaucracy toward modern, agile, and interconnected governance.\nWhat Is a Smart City and Why Does It Matter?\nA smart city is a model of urban development that integrates data, digital technology, and intelligent systems\nto manage city resources and services with maximum efficiency, sustainability, and alignment with citizen needs. These services span transportation, energy, public safety, environmental management, healthcare, and education.\nThe core goal of smart cities is not just technological advancement—it’s about improving the quality of life for citizens, lowering government operating costs, and building a sustainable urban economy. This is achieved through real-time decision-making, resource optimization, and fostering innovations that meet society’s evolving demands.\nUnderstanding Government Digital Transformation: The Foundation of a Smart City\nTrue smart city development cannot occur if public agencies cling to outdated structures and workflows. That’s why government digital transformation is the foundational step toward enabling seamless, future-ready governance.\nKey components of this transformation include:\nData Integration:\nConsolidating data across departments to form a cohesive picture of both the city and its citizens.\ne-Government:\nDelivering public services through digital channels that are fast, accessible, and convenient.\nBig Data & Analytics:\nCollecting and analyzing large-scale data to enable informed policymaking.\nCybersecurity:\nEnsuring strict data protection standards to build public trust.\nPublic-Private Partnerships: Accelerating the Path to Smart City Implementation\nPublic-Private Partnerships (PPP) are widely recognized as a vital driver of sustainable smart city development. Collaborating with private enterprises helps reduce the financial burden on governments while unlocking access to cutting-edge technology and domain expertise. Key initiatives include:\nDesigning user-friendly government services through improved UX/UI.\nDeveloping citizen-facing CRM systems to manage behavior data and engagement.\nCreating communication strategies that promote public understanding and service accessibility.\nSmart City Examples: Global Case Studies of Digital Urban Transformation\nTo better understand what a smart city looks like in action, here are several smart city examples from around the world that offer valuable insights for Thailand’s future:\nSingapore:\nA nationwide smart infrastructure system with environmental sensors, traffic tracking, and real-time health services integrated via mobile apps that link the government and citizens.\nEstonia:\nA pioneer in e-Government with e-Residency and e-Tax systems that enable citizens to access government services entirely online.\nDubai:\nA global leader in blockchain adoption for public services, reducing redundancy, enhancing transparency, and securing government data.\nChallenges Facing Thailand’s Smart City Transformation\nDespite Thailand’s active efforts to pursue smart city development, several challenges remain:\nDigital infrastructure is unevenly distributed, especially in remote areas.\nGovernment agencies often operate in silos, limiting data integration.\nPublic sector personnel lack digital and data management skills.\nPublic trust in how governments collect and use personal data is still low.\nThe Future of Government in Thailand’s Digital Age\nTo ensure long-term, sustainable smart city development, Thailand’s public sector must prioritize four strategic approaches:\n1. Design Thinking for Public Services\nBy shifting from a government-centric to a citizen-centric mindset, design thinking emphasizes empathy, user experience, and service simplicity. This approach reduces bureaucratic complexity and promotes inclusive, intuitive service design for all demographics.\n2. Open Data & Transparency\nGovernment transparency starts with open data—sharing structured, accessible information that citizens, businesses, and researchers can reuse. Public access to data like budgets, urban plans, and health statistics fuels innovation and strengthens policy accountability. Open data also builds public trust and fosters ongoing feedback that improves service delivery.\n3. Agile Governance\nMoving away from rigid bureaucratic systems, agile governance allows for flexible, cross-functional collaboration, rapid response to change, and continuous learning. Short-term goal setting and iterative feedback loops make public administration more adaptable and effective.\n4. Sustainability\nSustainability is key to smart city features. Digital public policies must consider environmental impact by incorporating long-term system resilience, clean energy usage, IoT-based waste management, and reduced paper consumption through digital service migration.\nSmart city development and government digital transformation are not merely technical initiatives—they represent a complete shift in governance philosophy, service delivery, and citizen engagement. Building structural readiness, welcoming private sector collaboration, and prioritizing quality of life are all essential to creating truly smart cities and enhancing Thailand’s long-term national competitiveness.\nFor public sector organizations ready to take the next step toward becoming a smart city, choosing a\nbusiness consulting company\nwith expertise in both digital technology and public governance is critical.\nJenosize\nis here to support your transformation journey—strategizing, building systems, and future-proofing your operations.

Why Businesses Must Adapt?\nOne of the biggest challenges in the digital era for service businesses is managing bookings efficiently, modernizing operations, and meeting customer demands around the clock. An online booking system has become an essential tool to solve these challenges. It not only ensures a seamless booking process but also reduces workload, enhances customer experience, and strengthens a business’s competitive edge in today’s technology-driven market.\nWhat Is an Online Booking System?\nAn online booking system is a platform or software designed to allow customers to book services or schedule appointments directly through a website or mobile application—without needing to call, message on social media, or visit the location in person.\nThe key advantage of an online booking system is its speed and accuracy. Automated systems can manage schedules, check availability, confirm bookings, and send real-time notifications to customers. They also allow businesses to instantly update service information, promotions, or special packages based on marketing strategies.\nThe Benefits of Online Booking Systems\nIn recent years, consumer behavior has shifted toward prioritizing convenience, speed, and 24/7 accessibility. As a result, an online booking system has become a crucial factor in enhancing operational efficiency and maintaining a competitive advantage for service-based businesses. The benefits of online booking systems include:\nEnhances Operational Efficiency\nAn online booking system reduces the workload of receptionists and administrative staff. It systematically handles appointment scheduling, booking confirmations, and notifications—helping to prevent double bookings and minimize scheduling errors.\nSupports Digital Consumer Behavior\nSince customers can book services anytime through a website or app, they no longer have to wait for business hours or call to make appointments. This increases sales opportunities and caters to diverse lifestyles.\nReduces Labor and Operating Costs\nBy automating bookings and scheduling, businesses can decrease the number of staff needed for customer service tasks, reduce paperwork costs, and save time on reporting.\nShowcases Promotions and Special Packages in Real-Time\nBusinesses can update promotions, packages, and special discounts directly on their websites or apps, making it easier for customers to compare options and make quick booking decisions. This feature helps boost bookings and revenue effectively.\nEnables Personalized Marketing Through Customer Data\nAn online booking system can collect booking histories, service usage behaviors, and customer feedback. This valuable data can be used for personalized marketing strategies such as sending exclusive offers, service reminders, or targeted promotional campaigns.\nStrengthens Professional Image and Credibility\nBusinesses that implement a booking system demonstrate a commitment to excellent customer service, standardized management, and reliable operations—all of which influence customer decisions and encourage long-term loyalty.\nIndustries That Can Benefit from an Online Booking System\nToday, booking systems are widely adopted across various industries, from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to retail businesses, government sectors, and nonprofit organizations. Some industries that can implement an online booking system include:\nHotels and Accommodation:\nAllow customers to select room types, check prices, and book instantly, with real-time promotion updates.\nRestaurants and Cafés:\nEnable customers to reserve tables at their convenience while providing timely updates on special offers and daily campaigns.\nHealth and Beauty Businesses:\nClinics, spas, massage parlors, and fitness centers can efficiently manage appointments and automate customer reminders, reducing in-store queues and double bookings.\nTransportation and Tourism Services:\nCar rentals, airline tickets, tours, and adventure activities can offer immediate price checks and service bookings to boost rapid sales.\nGovernment and Nonprofit Organizations:\nAn online booking system can help organize public service queues, schedule consultations, or manage event and seminar registrations.\nCase Study: Businesses Succeeding with Online Booking Systems\nTransitioning to digital operations is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity for improving efficiency and maintaining a competitive edge. Many businesses that have adopted booking systems report positive outcomes in sales, customer experience, and service user expansion. According to\nConsumer Search\n, here are some notable examples:\nHealth Clinics:\nInstalled an online booking system to allow patients to book appointments via their website 24/7, with automatic reminders. As a result, call volume dropped, no-shows decreased significantly, repeat appointments increased by 30%, and patient satisfaction improved.\nBeauty Salons:\nIntegrated a booking system into their website and app, allowing customers to book services and select stylists easily. They also displayed service profiles and recommendations. Within six months, new customer numbers grew by 25%, and the return rate of existing customers consistently increased.\nFitness Centers and Gyms:\nDeveloped a booking platform for classes and personal training sessions, making it easy for members to reserve spots via mobile. It helped minimize front desk congestion and reduced the need for phone reservations.

Next-Level Event Design\nTechnology\nMarketing\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n7\n0\nExplore Immersive Experience, One of the Event Trends 2025\nIn today’s fast-evolving marketing world, traditional slideshows and static booths are no longer enough. Instead, the immersive experience—a deeply emotional and interactive journey—has become the centerpiece of modern event design. Especially now, when audiences crave more than just \"viewing\"—they want to feel a brand’s presence.\nWhat Is Immersive Experience?\nAn immersive experience is a method of crafting an event environment that makes attendees feel like they’re entering a different world. This is achieved through a strategic blend of immersive technology, sensory engagement, and powerful storytelling. Its strength lies in its ability to create true immersion, stimulating emotions and all five senses to deliver long-lasting brand impressions.\nFrom a strategic standpoint, immersive experience design goes beyond dazzling visuals. It serves as a powerful tool to deepen customer relationships, drive sales opportunities, and communicate brand values in compelling, memorable ways.\nPopular Immersive Technologies for Event Design\nTo deliver a successful immersive experience, organizations must combine innovative immersive technology with creativity and strategic planning. Here are the leading technologies used in immersive event trends:\nVR (Virtual Reality)\nVR creates a fully simulated environment that allows participants to be \"inside\" a scenario. It’s ideal for product demonstrations, simulations, and complex storytelling.\nAR/XR (Augmented/Extended Reality)\nBy overlaying digital graphics onto the physical world, AR and XR make events more interactive and realistic—such as scanning an image to reveal a 3D model.\nProjection Mapping\nThis technique projects visuals or videos onto real-world surfaces like walls, buildings, or stages—transforming ordinary spaces into extraordinary visual experiences.\nSpatial Audio & Scent Design\nThese sensory elements enhance immersion by incorporating directional sound and scent, allowing audiences to emotionally connect with the environment in a more meaningful way.\nWhy Are Immersive Event Trends Booming in 2025?\nAs event trends 2025 continue to evolve, immersive event trends are setting a new standard across industries. Here’s why immersive experiences are in high demand:\nConsumers Value Experiences Over Products\nEspecially among\nGen Z and Millennials\n, the preference has shifted toward meaningful experiences rather than physical ownership—making immersive events highly attractive.\nBrands Need to Stand Out\nIn a saturated market, brands must exceed expectations by offering unique experiences that leave a lasting impression.\nTech Is More Accessible Than Ever\nAdvancements in immersive technology have lowered costs, making it feasible for small and mid-sized businesses—not just enterprise brands—to implement.\nKey Elements of a Successful Immersive Experience\nCreating a compelling immersive experience requires more than cutting-edge tech.

From geopolitical tensions and climate change to economic uncertainty and rapid technological advancements, today’s global vulnerabilities stem from these intertwined risk factors, creating cascading effects that are impossible to separate.\nAccording to the\nGlobal Risks Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum (WEF)\n, several risk factors demand urgent attention. This has prompted policymakers and organizations worldwide to take immediate action in preparing for potential threats across multiple dimensions. One effective approach involves leveraging in-depth data analysis and expert insights from\ndigital consulting\nto develop strategic, proactive risk management solutions.\n10 Global Risk Factors in 2025 That Organizations Must Prepare For Economic Risks\n1. Geopolitical Conflicts and Tensions\nPolitical conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties are major risk factors affecting the global economy. Tensions between major powers such as the United States, China, and Russia could lead to economic sanctions, trade restrictions, and disruptions in global supply chains. Additionally, conflicts in the Middle East and Asia may impact energy prices and financial market stability.\nOrganizations that rely on international markets must plan for these risks by diversifying their resources and business partners while closely monitoring trade policies and protectionist measures.\n2. Economic Crises and Financial Instability\nWhile many countries have begun recovering from the impacts of COVID-19, the global economy remains fragile. Economic slowdowns in major markets like the U.S. and Europe could have widespread effects across industries. Furthermore, rising interest rates and high levels of public debt continue to create financial uncertainties. Businesses should closely track economic indicators and develop financial strategies such as investment diversification and effective cash flow management to mitigate risks.\n3. Health Crises and Pandemics\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the risk of new disease outbreaks remains one of significant economic risks. Virus mutations, vaccine hesitancy, and limitations in healthcare systems in certain regions could lead to more uncontrollable outbreaks. Businesses that rely on a stable workforce and supply chains should develop health risk mitigation plans, such as adopting flexible work arrangements and enhancing workplace health and safety measures.\n4. Labor Shortages and Economic Inequality\nMany countries are facing labor shortages due to declining birth rates and shifting workforce structures. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) has also replaced certain job roles, potentially leading to unemployment for low-skilled workers. Organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforce while implementing policies that promote economic equality and access to opportunities.\n5. Shortages of Strategic Resources\nEssential resources for key industries, such as semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and clean energy, are facing supply shortages due to geopolitical and environmental factors. Uncertainties in international trade and geopolitical conflicts could further disrupt supply chains and increase production costs. Businesses must explore alternative resource sources, develop recycling technologies, and enhance domestic production capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.\nEnvironmental & Social Risks\n6. Environmental Disasters and Climate Change\nThe increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, severe storms, and heatwaves are significantly impacting global industries. Rising operational costs, disruptions in supply chains, and damage to infrastructure are becoming major challenges for businesses.\nClimate change is also driving regulatory shifts, pushing organizations to adopt cleaner energy sources and reduce carbon emissions. Businesses must develop adaptive strategies, including integrating sustainable practices, investing in resilient infrastructure, and optimizing resource efficiency. Furthermore, growing pressure from governments, investors, and consumers regarding ESG compliance is reshaping corporate priorities, making sustainability a critical factor for long-term success.\n7. Erosion of human rights and civil liberties\nThe increasing control over information, media restrictions, and tightening regulations on civil freedoms in various countries pose significant risks to businesses operating in those environments. Policies limiting access to information, imposing strict data regulations, and restricting freedom of expression can affect corporate transparency and hinder international trade. Additionally, human rights concerns such as forced labor, surveillance, and privacy violations can harm an organization’s reputation, lea\nding to consumer backlash and legal consequences. Companies must proactively address these risk factors by enforcing robust human rights policies, conducting thorough due diligence in supply chains, and\nensuring compliance with ethical business practices to maintain operational stability and stakeholder trust.\nTechnological Risks\n8. Social Divisions and Misinformation\nThe spread of misinformation and fake news has far-reaching impacts on both society and business, particularly in an age where social media plays a key role in communication. False information can lead to misunderstandings among consumers, negatively affecting brand reputation and sparking social conflicts. To mitigate the\nse technological risks, businesses must implement effective data governance policies, leveraging AI and Machine Learning to\ndetect false information, while enhancing transparency in their communications with customers and stakeholders.\n9. Technology and Cyber Threats\nThe advancement of technologies like AI,\nBlockchain\n, and\nQuantum Computing\npresents business opportunities but also increases cyber security risks. Threats such as ransomware and phishing attacks can lead to data breaches and significant financial damage. Companies need to invest in advanced cybersecurity systems, develop risk management strategies, and prioritize employee training on cyber threat prevention measures to safeguard their operations.\n10. Negative Impacts of Advanced Technology\nWhile technologies like\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nand automation enhance workplace efficiency, they also introd\nuce technological risks such as privacy violations, cyber security issues, and job displacement. Additionally, ethical concerns surrounding AI, such as algorithmic bias or misuse of personal data, may have legal and reputational consequences. Organizations adopting these technologies must focus on ethical development practices, implementing measures to prevent cyber threats, and ensuring personal data protection to minimize potential risks.\nIn order to reduce risk factors and enhance resilience in the face of crises, businesses, government agencies, and the public must collaborate to establish sustainable strategies.\nDigital consulting\nservices will play a vital role in connecting all stakeholders and assisting organizations in developing strategies that address the challenges of the digital era. This will enable organizations to adapt and develop appropriate solutions to navigate 2025 with greater strength and flexibility.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

This means that millions of clothing items are discarded every day, wasted. Even more shocking, some Fast Fashion brands are able to produce up to 52 new collections per year, or an average of one collection every week.\nFast Fashion’s Impact on the Environment\nThe fashion industry has become one of the largest CO2 emitters in the world, ranking second only to the oil industry. Another alarming statistic is that producing a single t-shirt requires 2,700 liters of water, which is the same amount of drinking water a person needs over 2.5 years.\nEv\nen more concerning, synthetic clothing produced by a fast fashion brand has become one of the largest sources of microplastics released into the oceans. Every time we do laundry, tiny plastic fibers are shed and enter the water system, eventually flowing into the seas. Fast fashion is therefore severely impacting marine ecosystems.\nThe Hidden Costs Behind “Affordability”\nWhen we th\nink of fast fashion brands, the first thing that comes to mind is usually affordability. But did you know that fast fashion carries many hidden costs that we may overlook? These costs are not reflected in the price tags bu\nt are burdens that society and the environment have to bear.\nExploitation of Labor in Developing Countries With Wages Below the Standard\nBehind the cheap prices\nof fast fashion clothing lies th\ne exploitation of labor in developing countries, where workers are paid well below a living wage. These workers must labor in dangerous conditions, long hours, and with inadequate benefits. Child labor is often found in the production chain, highlighting the hidden injustice.\nToxic Chemical Discharge into Water Sources from Dyeing Processes\nThe dyeing processes in th\ne fast fashion industry are\nmajor contributors to water pollution. Many factories discharge wastewater containing harmful chemicals into natural water sources without proper treatment. These chemicals not only destroy aquatic ecosystems but also harm the health of nearby communities. Many areas in major garment-producing countries, such as China and Bangladesh, have rivers that are discolored from the dye runoff.\nThe Creation of Non-Biodegradable Waste from Synthetic Fibers\nCheap clothing is often made from synthetic fibers due to their lower cost compared to natural fibers. However, these fibers are made from plastic that cannot decompose naturally. When these clothes are discarded in landfills, they can remain there for hundreds of years. Additionally, during use, washing clothes made from synthetic fibers releases microplastics into the water system, which eventually contributes to ocean pollution, impacting the entire food chain.\nWhat Can We Do as Entrepreneurs?\nAs fashion industry entrepreneurs, we can be part of the change towards creating a sustainable future by adjusting our business practices in several key ways:\nShifting Business Models to Sustainability\nChange needs to start from the foundation of the business by shifting from the “fast production, cheap sales” mo\ndel of fast fashion to one t\nhat emphasizes sustainability, such as:\nDeveloping a Circular Economy system in the supply chain\nUsing recycled materials and environmentally friendly fabrics\nReducing production volume while increasing product quality and longevity\nCreating clothing rental systems or second-hand platforms\nCreating Added Value Through Innovation\nInnovation is crucial for gaining a sustainable competitive edge, including:\nDeveloping water-and energy-efficient production technologies\nResearching and developing environmentally friendly materials\nUsing AI and Big Data to optimize production efficiency\nCreating a system to track sustainability throughout the supply chain\nAdjusting Marketing Strategies\nCommunication and marketing must evolve to create new values within the fashion industry, reducing the\npopularity of fast fashion brands:\nBuilding a brand that focuses on sustainability and social responsibility\nProviding transparent information about sourcing and manufacturing processes\nPromoting garment care to extend the lifespan of products\nRaising awareness about\nthe fast fashion’s problem\nManaging Long-term Risks\nLooking ahead and preparing for future challenges is essential, especially in the fashion industry, which is under pressure from multiple fronts. Businesses should:\nSystematically assess and manage environmental risks\nPrepare for increasingly stringent environmental regulations\nCollaborate with partners who share a vision for sustainability\nDevelop contingency plans for market shifts and crises\nInvesting in Human Resources\nDespite rapid advancements in technology and automation, human workers remain the heart of change in the fashion industry. Transitioning to sustainable fashion requires creativity, vision, and deep understanding, all of which are unique to humans. So, businesses should focus on:\nDeveloping sustainability skills and knowledge among employees\nCreating a fair and positive working environment\nPromoting an organizational culture that cares for the environment\nEncouraging employees to participate in developing sustainable innovations\nThe transition to a sustainable fashion business requires significant investment in the early stages, but the long-term returns make it worthwhile, both in terms of financial performance and in building a strong brand. Brands that are slow to adapt or remain committed to the\ntraditional fast fashion model risk losing\nmarket share to competitors who can pivot more quickly.\n﻿\nThe future of the fashion industry is no longer about the speed of production; it's about the intelligence in balancing profit, society, and the environment. Brands that can offer more than just beautiful clothes will lead the new market, where consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability each day.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nHow to Adapt Sustainability in Conflicting Industries\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nNature\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n481\n0\nWhen Sustainability Conflicts with Businesses: How to Adapt?\nIn today's world, environmental issues are gaining global attention, leading many industries to face significant challenges. This is especially true for industries often perceived as \"villains\" in environmental destruction. However, even industries that seem contrary to the idea of sustainability can adapt and evolve just like other businesses. In this article, we will explore three industries currently facing sustainability challenges and reveal adaptation strategies that can help these businesses thrive in an era when consumers are increasingly focused on \"eco-friendliness.\"\n3 Industries that Seem Contrary to Sustainability Trends but Are Adapting\n1. The Plastic Industry\nThe plastic industry is one of the most criticized for its environmental impact, including issues like plastic waste in the oceans, long degradation times, and the use of fossil resources in production. Despite the challenge of maintaining this industry in an increasingly environmentally conscious world, adaptation is not impossible.\nSustainability Adaptation Strategies for the Plastic Industry\nBioplastics\nBioplastics are made from agricultural materials such as corn, sugarcane, and cassava. They are biodegradable and decompose faster than conventional plastics, helping to reduce the amount of plastic waste in nature, especially in waterways and oceans. Additionally, using agricultural raw materials reduces reliance on fossil resources, which are limited and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\nAdvanced Recycling\nChemical recycling is an innovation that reprocesses used plastics into raw materials without losing material quality, allowing for multiple reuse cycles. This method not only reduces plastic waste but also decreases energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from new plastic production. It also addresses complex plastic waste management issues, such as mixed plastics or plastics with other contaminants.\nDesign for Recycling\nHistorically, plastic product designs did not consider recycling processes. Today, the concept of design for recycling is gaining popularity. This involves improving product design to make recycling easier, thus reducing unnecessary plastic waste. Good design considers easy disassembly, minimizing the use of chemicals that may hinder recycling, and using 100% recyclable materials like monomaterial plastics.\nMarine Degradable Plastics\nBeyond the issue of plastic waste accumulation in oceans, there are also microplastics that break off from regular plastics, affecting aquatic life. Therefore, developing plastics that can degrade in marine environments is an important goal. Such plastics help reduce plastic waste in water and maintain marine ecosystem balance amid the plastic pollution crisis.\n2. The Textile and Fashion Industry\nWhen discussing industries that impact the environment, many people think of the textile and fashion industry. This includes concerns about water usage, chemical emissions, and waste generated from producing Fast Fashion garments, which consumers often wear only a few times before discarding. However, this industry can also adapt to a more sustainable model.\nSustainability Adaptation Strategies for the Textile and Fashion Industry\nSustainable Materials\nChoosing environmentally friendly materials is a crucial step towards sustainability in the textile and fashion industry. Increasingly popular materials include organic natural fibers such as organic cotton, hemp, and linen, which are grown without harmful chemicals and pesticides, reducing soil and water contamination. Additionally, recycled fibers, such as those made from PET plastic bottles, offer a promising alternative, helping to reduce plastic waste and the natural resources needed to produce new fibers.\nEco-Friendly Dyeing Processes\nDyeing in the textile industry is a resource-intensive process that uses large amounts of water and releases harmful chemicals into wastewater. However, more sustainable dyeing techniques are emerging, such as dry dyeing, which uses less water, and natural dyes that are biodegradable, reducing the release of toxic chemicals into water sources.\nCircular Fashion\nOne popular approach is clothing rental, where consumers can rent garments for short periods instead of buying new ones. This reduces the accumulation of unused clothing in wardrobes. Additionally, buying second-hand clothes and recycling old garments are effective strategies. Recycling old clothes allows fibers to be reused and decreases the amount of clothing waste sent to landfills.\nOn-Demand Production\nFast Fashion typically involves mass production to meet market demand and rapidly changing fashion trends. The issue is that excess production often leads to unsold clothes being discarded or discounted, resulting in wasted resources and energy. On-demand manufacturing, which uses technology to produce garments based on actual orders, can address this issue. For example, 3D printing technology can produce custom clothing and reduce resource waste and greenhouse gas emissions from production and transportation processes.\n3. The Automotive Industry\nThe automotive industry is often viewed as contrary to sustainability principles due to the significant environmental impact associated with vehicle production and use. This includes fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generated from end-of-life vehicles. However, like the previous two industries, the automotive sector can also adapt to environmental trends in surprising ways.\nSustainability Adaptation Strategies for the Automotive Industry\nElectric Vehicles (EVs)\nThe most noticeable adaptation in recent times is the development of electric vehicles. EVs produce no greenhouse gas emissions during use, which helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution. They also decrease reliance on fossil fuels, which are limited resources with environmental impacts.\nEco-Friendly Manufacturing\nThis includes using renewable energy in manufacturing facilities, reducing water and chemical usage in vehicle production, and increasing the use of recycled materials in vehicle components. These practices not only minimize environmental impacts but also can lower long-term production costs.\nHybrid Vehicles and Alternative Fuel Vehicles\nIn addition to electric vehicles, hybrid cars that combine fossil fuel engines with electric motors are an option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels, are also a promising direction for the automotive industry to meet sustainability demands.\nAlthough these industries face significant environmental challenges, there are pathways and opportunities for achieving sustainability. By\nintegrating technological innovations\n, changing consumer behaviors, and supportive government policies, these industries can ultimately align with sustainable development principles.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

Among the initiatives driving this change,\n\"plant-based food\"\nstands out as\na business that creates opportunities\nwhile gradually reshaping the world. It's not just the way people consume that has evolved—this industry is revolutionizing perceptions of food and its impact on the environment.\nSo, it’s safe to say th\nat a plant-based food diet, or food deri\nved from plants, is not just another passing trend like so many others. It is, in fact, \"the next big thing\" that everyone needs to keep an eye on!\nWhat is Plant-Based Food, and Why is it Important?\nPlant-based food refers to food made primaril\ny from plant-based ingredients,\ndesigned and processed to replic\nate the taste, texture, protein content, and nutritional value of animal-based foods. Examples include plant-based meat zero burgers, steaks made from pea protein, and even plant-based ice cream.\nThanks to advancements in modern food technology, scientists and food experts have developed innovative production methods to create plant-based food that not only mimics the flavor but also closely resembles the structure and texture of animal-based pro\nducts. This breakthrough offers a sustainable and appealing alternative to traditional meat, addressing both consumer demand and environmental challenges.\nIs Plant-Based Food Good for You?\nPlant-based food diet is renowned for its exceptional nutritional value, being rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber while low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Nutritionists also highlight that a regular plant-based diet can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\nHowever, if you are wondering , is plant-based food good for you? The answer is “Yes.” And there are still more advantages of plant-based food that extend far beyon\nd health. Here are some additional benefits:\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nThe production of plant-based food has a significantly lower environmental impact compared to animal-based food. Studies reveal that producing plant-based food requires less water, emits fewer greenhouse gases, and uses agricultural land more efficiently, making it a sustainable choice for the planet.\nDiverse and Creative Options\nContrary to the misconception that a\nplant-based food diet is bland\nand monotonous, modern culinary innovations and technology have transformed it into a versatile and exciting category. From pea-protein burgers that taste like beef to plant-based sausages and even cheese made from fermented nuts, these creative offerings showcase the incredible evolution of alternative foods. They effectively erase outdated perceptions, proving that plant-based diets can be both flavorful and diverse.\nThe Benefits of Plant-Based Food for the Future of the World\nThe rise of plant-based food is not just abou\nt introducing plant-based diets; it represents a significant revolution with positive impacts on the future of humanity. Here’s how:\nPromoting Better Health for Modern Lifestyles\nIn today’s\nfast-paced and stressful world, a plant-based food diet offers a practical solution for health-conscious living. These foods help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.\nAdditionally, plant-based meat zero supports a stronger\nimmune system, aids in weight management, and boosts energy levels—perfectly aligning with the lifestyle of a new generation that prioritizes health and productivity.\nAddressing Food Waste and Resource Scarcity\nPlant-based food is a critical answer to the global challenges of food scarcity and resource depletion. Producing plant-based meat zero requires significantly fewer resources compared to animal farming—up to 90% less. For example, pr\noducing 1 kilogram of beef consumes approximately 15,000 liters of water, whereas producing 1 kilogram of plant-based protein uses only 1,500 liters.\nMoreover, this reduction in resource consumption not only conserves water but also minimizes deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and food waste, paving the way for a more sustainable future.\nDriving Sustainable Economic Growth\nT\nhe plant-based food industry is\nemerging as a major driver of\neconomic growth\n. With a projected market value of $74.2 billion by 2027, startups and major corporations are heavily investing in research and development of plant-based innovations. This creates new opportunities for employment and environmentally friendly investments, contributing to a sustainable global economy.\n﻿\nThe Rise of Plant-Based Food in Thailand: From Follower to Leader\nOnce a follow\ner of global plant-based food trends, Thailand is now stepping up a\ns a regional leader in the industry. With geographical advantages and a rich culinary heritage, the country is poised for success. Thailand’s key strengths include:\nHigh-Quality Plant-Based Ingredients:\nSoybeans, rice, and other key agricultural products.\nA Longstanding Vegetarian Food Culture:\nDeeply rooted traditions that support plant-based diets.\nA Creative and Adaptive Food Industry:\nKnown for innovation and the ability to evolve with market demands.\nThese strengths have enabled Thai companies to dev\nelop unique plant-based food offerings that blend traditional flavors of meat-based dishes with cutting-edge technology. As a result, Thailand is well on its way to becoming a significant leader in the global Plant-Based Food industry in the near future.\nIt is evident that a plant-based food diet is the answer to achieving a balance between personal health and a sustainable planet. It represents a future we can begin shaping today. Every choice you make about what you consume not only transforms you but also impacts the world on every level. If health is the goal, then the planet is the mission we must protect—and plant-based food is the bridge that connects them both.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

The conce\npt of regenerative business has emerged amidst a new awakening in the global business\ncommunity, based on the belief that businesses should not only be \"non-harmful\" but must step up to become \"drivers of positive change\" that help restore and heal ecosystems, society, and the economy simultaneously.\nWhat is Regenerative Business? From Sustainability to Industry Revitalization\nMoving beyond the traditional focus on merely reducing environmental harm, a new business model called \"Regenerative\" is gaining more attention. This approach takes sustainability a step further by focusing on the restoration of ecosystems and resources, aiming to bring them back to a state of abundance.\nRegenerative business refers to a w\nay of doing business that goes beyond simply reducing, preventing, or mitigating negative impacts. Its goal is to create positive effects by restoring value to the environment and ecosystems, as well as actively contributing to solving social issues. This represents a significant step forward in business practices.\nWhat is the Difference Between Regenerative Business and Sustainable Business?\nThe key difference between Sustainable and Regenerative Business is that sustainable businesses focus on \"avoiding harm\" or \"reducing negative impacts,\" while regenerative businesses focus on \"creating positive impacts\" and \"actively restoring systems\" in a tangible way.\nWhat are the Key Principles of Regenerative Business?\nHolistic System Thinking\nThis principle involves viewing problems and solutions in a holistic way by considering the interconnectedness of different systems—environmental, economic, and social. It emphasizes understanding and responding to the complexity of these systems, rather than just addressing isolated issues.\nCo-evolution\nBusiness is seen as a way to create shared value between organizations, society, and the environment. Organizations and systems develop together in harmony, rather than in isolation or competition.\nLiving Innovation\nThe focus is on creating innovations that are flexible, adaptable, and continuously evolving. These innovations should align with and reinforce the living systems around them, rather than being disconnected from their environment.\nRegenerative Cycles\nThe core of regenerative business is de\nsigning processes that circulate continuously. For example, reusing waste or by-products to create a complete natural cycle, without causing long-term loss or negative impacts.\nLong-term Resilience\nThe focus is on continuous development to ensure long-term sustainability, including the ability to adapt to and manage future changes.\nAdvantages of Regenerative Business\nCreating Sustainable Positive Value\nNot only does it reduce negative impacts, but it also creates positive effects and restores ecosystems to a better state. Additionally, it fosters development that sustains natural systems and society in the long run.\nCompetitive Advantage\nIt helps build a strong brand image and trust with consumers, organizations, and investors, while also enabling the creation of new innovations and added value for products and services.\nAdaptability to Change\nRegenerative businesses are highly flexible and ca\npable of adapting to challenges and changes in the future.\nFostering Long-term Collaboration and Development\nIt promotes sustainable development that aligns and supports the business, society, and environment, encouraging long-term cooperation and interdependence.\nDisadvantages of Regenerative Business\nInvestment Challenges\nTransitioning to a regenerative business model requires significant resources and investment, along with time to adjust and develop processes.\nDifficulty in Measuring Outcomes\nPerformance metrics are often unclear and challenging to assess, and success tends to manifest over the long term, not immediately.\nResistance from Traditional Organizations and Systems\nThere may be misunderstandings and resistance from some stakeholders, and the business may need to change its organizational mindset and culture.\nRegenerative Business and Real-World Examples of Application\nPatagonia\n, a manufacturer of outdoor gear and clothing, designs its products to be reusable by using recycled materials and eco-friendly resources. The company also supports movements to protect the environment and nature.\nIKEA,\na producer and retailer of furniture and home goods, aims to use 100% renewable or recycled materials by 2030. Additionally, it designs products that can be disassembled and reused, offering repair services and promoting the reuse of old furniture.\nInterface,\na manufacturer of carpets and flooring materials, aims to become \"Carbon negative\" by 2040. Currently, the company incorporates waste materials and recycled resources in its production, and designs its products to be reusable.\nIn summary, regenerative business is a revolutionary approach to business that is essential for survival in the 21st century. Organizations that understand and adapt quickly will lead in the newmarket era, where consumers are increasingly focused on the positive impact on society and the environment.

At the same time, businesses must adapt to face this challenge. Therefore, we are here to help you gain a deeper understanding of what the\ne-waste\nproblem entails, along with revealing\nways to conduct business\nthat aligns with the global sustainability trend.\nUnderstanding the E-waste Problem\nE-waste r\nefers to electronic and electrical devices that have reached the end of their lifespan\n, are damaged, or outdated, including their related components such as computers, mobile phones, televisions, household appliances, and other electronic equipment discarded as waste. The major causes of the growing amount\nof e-waste toda\ny include:\nRapid technological development:\nTechnological advancements lead to the constant release of new products into the market, driving consumers to upgrade their devices to keep up with modern trends.\nConsumer culture:\nIn today's society, there is a strong value placed on using new and modern products, resulting in frequent electronic upgrades, even when the older devices are still functional.\nShorter product lifespans:\nSome manufacturers design products with shorter lifespans to boost sales and encourage customers to regularly switch to newer models.\nDifficulty in repairs:\nModern electronic devices are often designed in a complex manner, making them difficult to repair or replace parts. As a result, consumers tend to purchase new devices rather than repair the old ones.\nLack of efficient management systems:\nMany countries, including Thailand, still lack prop\ner e-waste recycling and ma\nnagement systems, leading to electronic waste being mixed with general waste.\nWhat Impact Does E-waste Have on the World?\nEnvironmental Impact\nE-waste is a seriou\ns environmental problem because electronic devices contain many hazardous chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants. When discarded, these substances can contaminate the soil and water, negatively affecting ecosystems and living organisms. Additionally, improper b\nurning of e-waste re\nleases air pollutants, toxic substances, and greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, further worsening air quality.\nImpact on Human Health\nExposure to toxic substances f\nrom e-waste, whether directly or through environmental contamination, has long-term adverse effects on human\nhealth. For instance, lead impacts the nervous system and brain development, especially in children. Mercury damages the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver, while cadmium increases the risk of cancer and harms the circulatory system.\nLoss of Resources and Biodiversity\nImproperly man\naged e-waste leads to the loss of valuable resources such as gold, silver, copper, and rare earth minerals, which could otherwise be recycled. Discarding e-waste without recycling requires the extraction of new resources, affecting ecosystems and biodiversity in mining areas.\nClimate Change Contribution\nThe production of new electronic devices and improper dispos\nal of e-waste contribute\nto greenhouse gas emissions and the release of harmful dioxins, playing a significant role in climate change.\nLand Management Challenges\nThe rapid increa\nse in e-waste poses land management challenges, particularly in developing countries, which often become the dumping grounds for e-waste from developed nations. A lack of proper space and management systems leads to open dumping or impr\noper landfill practices, which harm the environment and the health of nearby communities.\n﻿\nBusiness Strategies to Reduce Environmental Impact and Promote Sustainability\nSustainable Product Design\nBusinesses can help address\nthe e-waste problem by focusing on sustainable product design, known as \"eco-design.\" This approach not only reduces e-waste but also enhances the brand image and meets the growing demand from environmentally-conscious\nconsumers. Key principles include:\nDesigning products with longer lifespans.\nUsing eco-friendly and recyclable materials.\nMaking products easy to disassemble and repair.\nReducing the use of hazardous substances in the manufacturing process.\nTake-back and E-waste Recycling Policies\nBusinesses can initiate take-back programs for old products, allowing them to be recycled or properly disposed of. This helps reduce the amount of e-waste enter\ning the environment while building brand loyalty and recovering valuable materials. Examples include:\nOffering discounts on new products when customers return old devices.\nSetting up collection points for old electronics in stores or service centers.\nPartnering with certified recycling companies to efficiently manage e-waste.\nGreening the Supply Chain\nManaging the supply chain to be more environmentally friendly is a key strategy for reducing e-waste, promoting sustainability, and cutting business costs. This can be achieved through the following steps:\nCollaborating with suppliers that have strong environmental policies and strictly adhere to environmental standards.\nPromoting the use of recycled materials in production to reduce reliance on new resources and minimize waste.\nDesigning packaging that uses less material while maintaining product protection, and choosing biodegradable materials.\nClean and Energy-efficient Operations\nAs e-waste becomes an increasingly severe environmental issue, simply managing electronic waste may no longer be enough. Switching to clean energy and improving energy efficiency can help reduce e-waste in the futu\nre. For example:\nConsider installing solar panels or wind turbines to generate electricity for internal use.\nInstall energy-efficient lighting, upgrade insulation, and use high-efficiency air conditioning systems.\nChoose energy-saving computers, printers, and other office equipment with energy efficiency labels.\nImplement automated control systems to optimize energy usage based on actual demand.\nIf generating clean energy in-house is not feasible, consider purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources through utility programs.\nConducting business with consideration for e-waste and sustainability is not only a social and environmental responsibility but also a way to create new business opportunities. This includes developing eco-friendly products, building a positive brand image, and reducing long-term costs through efficient resource use. Such practices prepare businesses to better handle increasingly stringent environmental regulations in the future, while also meeting the demands of modern consumers who prioritize environmentally friendly products and services.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",
