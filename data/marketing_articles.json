But for brands, it’s a golden opportunity to ramp up their\nmarketing\nefforts and skyrocket sales! Have you ever noticed that everything from global leading brands to small SMEs is now focusing on\nfestive marketing\nstrategies? This approach targets customers’ hearts during the most vibrant and high-spending time of the year.\nWhat is Festive Marketing?\nFestive marketing is a marketing str\nategy that leverages festivals or holidays as the key selling point to capture customer interest\nand drive sales to exceed targets. Whether it’s New Year, Valentine’s Day, Songkran, Halloween, or even online shopping festivals like Double Date campaigns and Black Frida\ny, festive season marketing plays a crucial role.\nAlso known as holiday marketing, this approach focuses on creating holiday marketing campaigns that resonate with the emotions and sentiments of consumers during s\npecific festive periods. The main goals are to attract attention, generate demand, and ultimately maximize sales.\nWhy is Festive Season Promotion Effective?\nFestive seasons put consumers in a good mood and ready to spend\nFestive periods are special times when consumers tend to be happier, more positive, and more willing to spend money. Whether it’s buying gifts, traveling, or creating special experiences, marketers can tap into these emotions to drive increased purchases of products and services.\nFOMO Behavior (Fear of Missing Out)\nFestive marketing strategies\nleverage the consumer's “fear of missing out” by offering exclusive deals, limited-time discounts, or festival-only promotions. This creates a sense of urgency, making customers feel they’ll miss out on great opportunities if they don’t buy now.\nConsumers plan their purchases ahead of time during festive seasons\nMost consumers plan their shopping in advance for festivals, especially for gifts, souvenirs, or celebration preparations. This gives marketers a golden opportunity to present products and services that align with the target audience's needs and preferences.\nStrategies for Successful Festive Marketing\nIdentify the Golden Timing of Each Festival\nTiming is key to executing an effect\nive festive marketing strategy. Each festival comes with its own timeframe and emotional a\nppeal, so marketers need to plan ahead and act at the right moment. For example:\nNew Year:\nStart planning and communicating from mid-December.\nValentine’s Day:\nLaunch\nholiday marketing campaigns from late Ja\nnuary.\nSongkran (Thai New Year)\nPrepare\nfestive promotion sta\nrting in March.\nCreate Unique Experiences\nCrafting tailored experiences for customers during each festive period helps leave a lasting impression and creates positive memories. This can be achieved through:\nDesigning special gift packages.\nBuilding campaigns with emotional storytelling.\nOrganizing special events or engaging challenges.\nUse Content to Inspire Purchase Intent\nEffective marketing content acts like a story, subtly building emotions and driving consumer demand. Brands should not only showcase products but also create shared experiences and emotional connections with customers through:\nShort videos with impactful stories and emotions.\nBeautiful visuals that convey the product’s value impressively.\nInspirational storytelling that connects products with customers' dreams and goals.\nReal user reviews and testimonials that build trust and credibility.\nOffer Compelling Promotions to Attract Consumers\nAttractive festive promotion is critical to grabbing consumer attention. Beyond\nsimple discounts, brands can add value in other creative ways, such as:\nSpecial giveaways with meaningful value for users.\nFlexible installment options to ease financial burdens.\nSatisfaction guarantees to instill confidence in customers.\nProfessional Planning for Festive Season Promotion\nPrepare Holiday Marketing Campaigns in Advance\nStart by gaining a deep understanding of the festival context, consumer sentiment, and business goals. This planning process includes several critical steps, such as:\nDesigning creative content that aligns with the emotions and context of the festival.\nSetting an accurate advertising budget based on business goals and expected returns.\nChoose the Right Channels\nEach platform has its own strengths and user demographics, so no single channel can replace another. Marketers must analyze which platforms suit their brand best:\nFacebook:\nIdeal for detailed advertising and reaching a diverse age range of users.\nInstagram:\nAttracts consumers through stunning visuals and videos, perfect for image-driven products.\nTikTok:\nEngages younger audiences with creative and entertaining content.\nE-commerce:\nA direct sales channel that effectively tracks measurable results.\nMeasure and Adjust Strategies Using Clear KPIs\nMeasuring and refining strategies is like using a compass to guide your marketing journey. Defining clear KPIs is crucial, as these metrics will help you understand consumer behavior, needs, and campaign performance. Key indicators include:\nSales performance\nEngagement rates\nAd click-through rates (CTR)\nConversion rates\nHow to Boost Product Sales During Festivals with Festive Marketing\nUtilize Influencer Marketing\nInfluencer marketing\nis a powerful tool to connect brands with target audiences. Brands should carefully select influencers who align with the following criteria:\nHave followers that match the target customer group\nCredibility and an image consistent with the brand\nAbility to create engaging and compelling content\nOffer Limited Edition Products\nLimited edition products, or items with restricted availability, can generate excitement and a sense of urgency. During festivals, brands should:\nDesign unique, special-edition products exclusive to the season\nPromote the idea that once sold out, they won’t be restocked, creating a “must-own” feeling among shoppers\nSend Exclusive Deals to Existing Customers via Email or Apps\nRetaining loyal customers\nis just as important as attracting new ones. Brands can:\nSend special deals through emails or applications to encourage repeat purchases\nShow appreciation and remind customers of their importance\nUse loyalty programs, like reward points or exclusive gifts, to strengthen customer relationships and boost brand loyalty\nDesign Holiday Marketing Campaigns That Encourage Sharing\nCreating sh\nareable holiday marketing campaigns can amplify brand reach and awareness during festive seasons. Brands can:\nDevelop creative, unique, and attention-grabbing content that customers want to share\nIntroduce fun challenges with opportunities for consumers to compete for rewards\nOffer incentives for sharing, which helps significantly increase brand visibility and engagement\nIn the highly competitive world of marke\nting, adapting to customer behavior during festive seasons is crucial.

    "content": "<\nBack\n5 TikTok Marketing Strategies Brands Must Not Miss in 2025\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n345\n0\nTrending Now! 5 TikTok Marketing Tricks to Boost Sales\nTikTok is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms, reaching over a billion users worldwide in just four years. More than just a short-form video platform, TikTok is a powerful marketing channel for small businesses and brands looking to boost brand awareness and drive sales.\nWhy Should Businesses Prioritize TikTok Marketing?\nExpands Audience Reach\nOne of TikTok’s biggest advantages is its algorithm, which prioritizes content discovery over simply displaying posts from followed accounts. This allows businesses to reach their target audience more effectively, even without a large follower base.\nHigher Engagement Rate Than Other Platforms\nMarketers familiar with TikTok marketing know that the platform is known for its high engagement rates. Users are more likely to like, comment, and share videos compared to other social platforms, increasing visibility and impact for brand content.\nEasier for Content to Go Viral\nTikTok’s For You Page (FYP) recommendation system enables brand videos to go viral quickly, provided they are engaging and align with trending topics.\nTikTok Shop Enhances E-Commerce Opportunities\nWith TikTok Shop and LIVE Shopping features, businesses can sell products directly on the platform, making it easier to drive conversions and boost sales.\n5 TikTok Marketing Strategies Businesses Should Use in 2025\n1. Create a TikTok Business Account and Utilize TikTok Analytics\nA TikTok Business Account gives brands access to essential features like TikTok Analytics. This tool helps track content performance, analyze audience behavior, and refine TikTok marketing strategies for better results.\n2. Use Trending Audio to Increase Content Visibility\nTrending music and sounds play a crucial role in boosting content reach on the FYP. Businesses should stay updated on popular audio trends and integrate them into their content to maximize audience engagement.\n3. Focus on Content That Builds Trust\nConsumers prioritize transparency and trust in brands. Businesses can build credibility through short-form videos such as:\nBehind-the-scenes footage of product manufacturing or service processes.\nEmployee-led product reviews instead of relying solely on external creators.\nReal-time customer Q&A sessions via TikTok Live.\n4. Leverage TikTok Shop and LIVE Shopping to Boost Sales\nBrands aiming to increase sales through TikTok Marketing should utilize TikTok Shop and LIVE Shopping. These features allow customers to purchase products directly while watching videos or live streams.\nAccording to global market research firm Ipsos\n, 50% of TikTok users have bought a product after watching a LIVE session.\n5. Use Hashtag Challenges to Generate Buzz and Attract New Users\nHashtag Challenges are a highly effective TikTok marketing strategy for increasing brand awareness and attracting new audiences. Businesses can create branded hashtags related to their products or services, encouraging users to generate content using those hashtags. This boosts visibility and fosters community engagement on TikTok.\nCase Study: Brands That Succeeded with TikTok Marketing\nChipotle’s Hashtag Challenge Campaign\nChipotle achieved massive success with its #ChipotleLidFlip challenge, which encouraged users to creatively flip a sauce cup lid. The results:\nOver 110,000 video submissions within the first six days.\n104 million total views.\nSignificant sales growth and increased brand engagement.\nDuolingo’s Viral Brand Character Strategy\nDuolingo leveraged its mascot, Duo the Owl, as the central character in its TikTok content. By giving the mascot a playful, cheeky personality, Duolingo achieved:\n﻿\nOver 16 million TikTok followers.\nMillions of views per video.\nIncreased brand awareness and app popularity.\nWith its high engagement rates, sales-driven features, and potential for viral content, TikTok has become an essential platform for businesses.

    "content": "<\nBack\n7 Storytelling Techniques Brands Should Use to Stand Out\nMarketing\nBusiness\nMotivation\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n46\n0\n7 Proven Storytelling Techniques That Make Brands Memorable\nEvery time you scroll through social media, you're hit with a rapid flood of content. In today’s hyper-competitive business world, success isn’t just measured by numbers or data—it’s also about how well you communicate your message. That’s where\nstorytelling\ncomes in. This powerful communication skill can transform basic information into an emotional experience that captures attention and drives consumer action.\nIf your brand aims to stand out, mastering and applying business storytelling techniques effectively is a crucial tool. It helps enhance brand perception, boost audience engagement, and drive sustainable business results.\nWhy Storytelling Is a Must-Have Skill in Today’s World ?\nWhat is storytelling? It’s both a science and an art—not just presenting facts, but crafting emotionally resonant narratives that connect with your audience.\nResearch from\nThe New York Times\nfound that while data-driven content only activates the part of the brain responsible for basic language processing, compelling storytelling techniques trigger multiple regions of the brain, including those linked to sensory experiences. This makes stories far more memorable and engaging than standard communication.\n7 Storytelling Techniques Every Brand Should Use\n1. Choose the Right Story at the Right Time\nNot every campaign needs to tell your brand’s full history. Select a story that aligns with the current context and resonates with your audience. A good story should immediately answer the question, “Why does this matter to me?” and spark emotional responses like empathy, curiosity, or inspiration—leading your audience to take action.\n2. Start with a Strong Hook\nIn an era where users decide within seconds whether to keep watching, a compelling hook is everything. It could be a thought-provoking question, a surprising statistic, or an emotionally charged statement. The goal is to make people want to know what happens next.\n3. Structure Your Story with Purpose\nGreat storytelling needs clear structure. One effective method is the IRS Model, which brings balance and emotional momentum to your narrative:\nIntriguing Beginning – Open with something that piques curiosity.\nRiveting Middle – Introduce a twist, challenge, or conflict that builds anticipation.\nSatisfying Ending – Conclude with a clear takeaway that encourages decision-making.\n4. Use Relatable and Universal Plotlines\nOne of the core principles of effective storytelling techniques is using universally understood plot structures. This makes it easier for your audience to connect with your message and see the human side of your brand. Examples include:\nOrigin Story – Share how your brand or product began.\nUnderdog Story – Tell of someone who overcame the odds.\nOvercoming the Monster – Highlight challenges your brand or customer conquered.\n5. Use Analogies to Explain Complex Ideas\nTo simplify complex topics, use analogies or metaphors. For instance, explain strategic planning as a chess match, or compare using cloud services to renting an office rather than building one. This not only makes your content easier to understand but also adds creativity to your narrative.\n6. View the Story from the Audience’s Perspective\nPut yourself in your audience’s shoes. What are their expectations, fears, or pain points? Then design your story to meet them there. When you tailor your narrative to their emotional and informational needs, it becomes the solution they’ve been looking for—not just another message from a brand.\n7. Use the Right Tone of Voice\nEven the best story can fall flat if delivered in the wrong tone. Match your tone to your brand identity, audience, and platform. For example, a TikTok video may call for a friendly and casual tone, while website content may require a more formal and credible voice.\nCase Study: Brands That Excel at Storytelling\nThai Life Insurance\nA standout example of storytelling in action is Thai Life Insurance. Known for emotionally powerful yet simple narratives, their campaigns often focus on everyday people making sacrifices for others or overcoming hardships. These stories are crafted to evoke empathy and convey deep life values, making them truly unforgettable.\nNike\nNike has long mastered strategic storytelling—especially through tales of athletes pushing past their limits to achieve greatness. Campaigns like “Just Do It” and stories of individuals who weren’t born champions but fought their way to success inspire audiences by reinforcing the message: If they can do it, so can I.\nIt's clear that storytelling is an essential skill for brands of all sizes. In a world overwhelmed by information, businesses must differentiate themselves through goal-driven, emotionally resonant narratives that align with their audience’s core values. While data and statistics may be forgotten, a story that touches the heart will always be remembered.\nIf you're an entrepreneur looking to clearly and effectively communicate your brand identity, we’re here to help turn your message into a memorable campaign.

    "content": "<\nBack\nLIVE Commerce is Booming! 7 Tips to Boost Sales via LIVE\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n591\n0\n7 Expert Tips to Boost Sales with LIVE Commerce\nIn today’s rapidly evolving digital marketing landscape, one trend that has gained significant popularity is\nLIVE commerce\n—the practice of selling products through LIVE streaming on online platforms. The combination of LIVE video and e-commerce not only creates a more immersive shopping experience, but it can also effectively drive customer purchasing decisions. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or retail businesses looking to increase sales and reach their target audience more accurately, adopting LIVE commerce is a strategy you should not overlook!\nWhat is LIVE Commerce, and Why Is It Gaining Popularity?\nLIVE commerce is the process of selling products through LIVE streaming, which allows sellers to engage with customers in real-time.\nDuring a LIVE broadcast, sellers can introduce products, answer customer questions, and interact with the audience, providing detailed product information that makes it easier for consumers to make purchasing decisions. The benefits of LIVE commerce, which have made LIVE selling so popular, include:\nReal-time interaction:\nCustomers can ask questions about products and receive immediate answers from the seller, which helps reduce concerns and boosts their confidence in making a purchase.\nImpulse buying through promotions:\nSpecial discounts or flash sales during LIVE broadcasts encourage customers to buy quickly.\nIncreased reach and engagement:\nLIVE streaming allows you to reach a broad audience instantly and engage with them in an efficient, interactive way.\nReal-time product reviews:\nCustomers can witness LIVE demonstrations of products, which helps alleviate concerns about product quality.\nHow to Do LIVE Commerce: 7 Proven Techniques to Boost Your Sales\n1. Plan Content and Strategy Before Going LIVE\nBefore you start your LIVE stream, it’s essential to plan the content in advance to ensure the broadcast is clear and has a clear direction. Set topics to discuss, such as product launches, reviews, or special promotions. Organize the order of product presentations systematically, which helps keep the LIVE session smooth and engaging for your audience.\nSpecial Tip:\nUse the \"Before-After\" technique to show the clear results of using your product. For example, show a before image of a common issue, such as acne (Before), and then demonstrate the result after using your product, like clear, glowing skin (After), to help viewers understand the product’s benefits more clearly.\n2. Choose the Right Platform for Your Target Audience\nSelecting the right platform for your target audience is crucial to ensure your LIVE broadcast gains the most interest from the right viewers. Consider how to do LIVE commerce on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Choose the platform where your audience is most active, making it easier for them to join and engage with your LIVE session.\nSpecial Tip:\nUnderstand which platforms your target audience uses most frequently and where you're likely to get the best response. For example, TikTok is ideal for younger audiences, Instagram is perfect for showcasing a stylish, visually appealing brand image, and Facebook allows access to a wide range of age groups.\n3. Use Storytelling to Captivate Your Audience\nTelling an engaging story about your products or services can help capture your audience's attention. Effective techniques include the \"Before-After\" or \"Problem-Stimulate-Solve\" methods. These strategies clearly demonstrate the benefits of your product. For example:\n\"Did you know that 90% of wrinkles are caused by UV rays?\" (Problem)\n\"Even on cloudy days, UV rays can penetrate and damage your skin’s collagen.\" (Stimulate)\n\"Our sunscreen protects against UV rays and prevents wrinkles with SPF 50+ PA++++.\" (Solve)\n4. Ask Questions and Use Activities to Encourage Engagement\nEngaging your audience through polls, questions, or activities increases participation. For example, offering giveaways to viewers who share your LIVE stream or ask questions about the product encourages more interaction. Activities like randomly selecting winners to receive free products or discount codes can further boost engagement.\n5. Apply Urgency & Scarcity Strategies\nCreating a sense of urgency and scarcity can push customers to make faster purchase decisions. Announce limited stock or exclusive promotions available only during the LIVE stream. This generates excitement and prompts quicker buying decisions. Examples:\n\"Limited stock available—order now before it’s gone!\"\n\"Special promotion! Get 20% off today only during this LIVE session!\"\n6. Promote Your LIVE Session Effectively Before and After\nPromoting your LIVE stream in advance generates anticipation and lets your audience know when and where to tune in. After the LIVE session, promoting highlights or product reviews will allow those who missed the LIVE broadcast to watch it later.\nSpecial Tip:\nUse social media platforms like Instagram Stories or Facebook posts to announce your LIVE session in advance. Afterward, upload a highlight reel or product review for those who missed the LIVE event.\n7. Analyze Results and Improve Your Strategy\nAfter your LIVE session ends, it’s crucial to analyze the results, including the number of viewers, engagement levels, and sales. This data will help you refine your LIVE commerce strategy for future sessions. By identifying what worked well and what needs improvement, you can optimize your approach for even better results.\nSpecial Tip:\nReview comments and feedback from your viewers to understand what they liked or didn’t like. Use this information to enhance your strategy and tailor your LIVE commerce sessions to better meet your audience's needs.\nLIVE commerce is a powerful tool for boosting sales and building real-time customer relationships. For SMEs or retail businesses looking to implement this\nretail marketing\nstrategy, focusing on content planning, choosing the right platform, employing storytelling techniques, and encouraging customer engagement will help you succeed. By applying the right strategies, LIVE commerce can become a highly effective tool for expanding your business and increasing sales opportunities in the digital age.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\nWhat Is Event Marketing? Connecting Brands with Customers\nArt\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n23\n0\nWhat Is Event Marketing? Building Brands Through Experience\nIn today’s digital era, consumer choices are abundant, and attention spans are short. Creating tangible, memorable experiences has become a critical strategy for brands to stand out.\nEvent marketing\nis one such powerful tool—enabling brands to showcase their products, services, or values through interactive events. These can take place both offline and online, helping to foster brand recognition, emotional engagement, and long-term loyalty with target audiences.\nWhat Is Event Marketing?\nEvent marketing is the strategic process of planning, managing, and communicating a brand through specifically designed events. The goal is to build brand awareness, strengthen customer engagement, and drive purchase decisions. Ultimately, event marketing aims to develop long-term relationships with customers.\nWhat does event marketing involve? It depends on the brand’s objective. Examples include:\nProduct launches\nTrade shows\nWorkshops or seminars\nExperiential events\nBooth participation at expos or festivals\nSocial media campaigns and competitions\nWhy Is Event Marketing Important?\nTraditional advertising is no longer enough to capture consumer interest. Today’s businesses need to create experiences that resonate. The importance of event marketing lies in its ability to:\nDifferentiate your brand in saturated markets.\nA well-executed event can make a brand memorable and build a distinctive image.\nDrive engagement and emotional connection.\nThoughtfully designed events allow customers to feel part of the brand experience.\nGather valuable audience insights.\nFrom registrations and surveys to behavioral tracking, events provide actionable data on target groups.\nEnable real-time sales opportunities.\nEvents not only encourage purchases during the event but also allow sales teams to engage directly with qualified prospects.\nBuild brand credibility.\nProfessionally run events elevate brand perception and build trust with both new and existing audiences.\nTypes of Event Marketing for Modern Businesses\nModern event marketing is far more than just trade booths and corporate functions. Businesses today can align their events with consumer behavior and current technologies in several ways:\nBrand Activation\nThese are public activities designed to raise awareness and form emotional bonds with the brand. For example, offering product sampling in a shopping mall or hosting an outdoor experience that encourages social media sharing. One of notable event marketing examples is a coffee brand’s “Brew in the Park” event, where customers tasted fresh brews and learned the process hands-on.\nHybrid Events\nThis approach combines offline and online elements, allowing brands to reach a wider audience. For example, a hotel seminar can be livestreamed on Zoom or Facebook Live, with real-time Q&A from online attendees. This type of event marketing removes geographic limits and provides measurable digital data.\nExperience Marketing\nFocused on immersive activities, experience marketing helps participants connect meaningfully with the brand. Examples include product demonstrations set in real-life environments or booths designed with specific themes, like a Japanese cooking station hosted by a condiment brand. These experiences create lasting brand impressions.\nEvent Marketing Examples: Case Studies from Successful Campaigns\nWhen done strategically, event marketing activities can drive tangible results and foster nationwide brand affinity. Below are two government-led examples that highlight success in both sales and brand communication:\nOffline 2 Online Expo\nOne of outstanding event marketing examples is the Offline 2 Online Expo by Thailand’s Department of Business Development. The expo promoted local products nationwide through a series of trade fairs held across five major regions, covering over 2,000 square meters of event space.\nJenosize, the agency responsible for event planning and execution over nine months, applied a blended event marketing strategy—merging on-ground activation with digital engagement.\nResults:\nThis cross-platform strategy attracted thousands from diverse regions, boosting total spending from the initial THB 30 million target to over THB 80 million. The event also showcased the potential of event marketing to uplift local economies and drive real-time sales.\nMinistry of Science Innovation Showcase\nAnother case highlights the use of event marketing to amplify innovation. The Ministry of Science organized an outdoor event in downtown Bangkok to showcase over 100 tech-enhanced products, many requiring live demonstrations to illustrate real-world benefits.\nResults:\nWith Jenosize overseeing event space planning, products like fruit-harvesting tools and agricultural devices had ample room for hands-on interaction. Visitors experienced the products firsthand, improving public perception of Thai innovations and encouraging future business expansion.\nKey Considerations for Effective Event Marketing\nWhile event marketing is a powerful way to create memorable experiences and strong connections, poor execution or overlooked details can hinder success. The following best practices ensure your event marketing activities align with your business goals:\n1. Set Clear Objectives\nDefine a specific goal—whether launching a product, increasing short-term sales, or raising brand awareness. Clear objectives help guide event structure, messaging, and performance tracking.\n2. Choose the Right Venue and Timing\nThe venue should match the audience’s convenience and the event’s purpose. For instance, a product launch may work best in a bustling retail space, while academic sessions fit better in conference halls. Plan early to allow sufficient preparation.\n3. Promote Your Event Widely\nDon’t underestimate pre-event promotion. Use social media, email marketing, online campaigns, or even on-site ads to attract quality attendees and boost participation.\n4. Collect Data and Measure Success\nTrack attendees, engagement levels, and feedback to assess your event's impact. Use these insights to optimize future event marketing strategies, such as adjusting formats or enhancing specific touchpoints.\n5. Prepare for the Unexpected\nEvents are prone to surprises—bad weather, technical glitches, or unexpected crowd sizes. Always have a backup plan and a team trained to adapt swiftly to maintain a high-quality experience.\nEvent marketing is more than organizing an event—it’s a strategic communication tool that builds sustainable brand value. It allows companies to deliver their value proposition directly to the audience in an impactful, human-centric way. In a world where people value meaningful experiences over promotional messaging, a well-planned event marketing strategy can set your brand apart and drive long-term success.\nIf your organization is seeking a trusted partner to design and\nmanage events\nthat truly connect with your target audience,\nJenosize\noffers end-to-end event marketing services tailored to your brand’s goals.

Leveraging Social Platforms for Brand Promotion\nSocial Media Marketing (SMM) involves using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn to promote products and services\n, build brand awareness, and engage with customers. SMM enables businesses to reach a large audience in a short amount of time and interact with customers through engaging content.\nAdvantages of Social Media Marketing\nQuick Audience Reach:\nSMM helps businesses engage with customers rapidly.\nEnhances Customer Engagement:\nSMM enables close interaction between brands and customers.\nSupports Various Content Formats:\nImages, videos, and text can be used to promote products.\nReal-Time Strategy Adjustments:\nMarketers can change strategies immediately when content isn't performing well.\nLimitations of Social Media Marketing\nRequires Constant Content Management:\nTo keep content interesting, ongoing updates are essential.\nPotential Reach Decline:\nChanging platform algorithms may reduce post reach.\nInvestment in Paid Ads:\nPaid ads are often needed to reach a broader audience and increase visibility.\nComparison of SEO, SEM, and SMM: Which Is More Important?\nThe answer to this question depends on your business goals. If you want to build sustainable traffic and establish long-term credibility, SEO is the best strategy. If you need fast and effective reach to increase visibility quickly, SEM is the right choice. On the other hand, if your goal is to engage customers rapidly, increase brand awareness, and boost engagement, Social Media Marketing (SMM) will be the most suitable option.\nHowever, online marketing doesn’t have to be limited to just one strategy. Combining SEO, SEM, and SMM can lead to the best results for your business. For example, you could use SEO to attract customers through search results, while using social media to maintain customer relationships or SEM to increase reach in a limited time and immediately capture customer interest.\nIn conclusion, whether SEO, SEM, or SMM, all these strategies are important. Each has its strengths and limitations, and a well-rounded approach that blends search engine marketing and social media can help your business increase reach, establish credibility, and drive sales effectively. Businesses should select the most appropriate online marketing channels based on their goals and continuously adapt to the behavior of their target audience for the best outcomes.\nIf your business needs assistance in planning the right online marketing strategy, consider using a professional\nonline marketing service\nto optimize your campaigns.

How to Measure Your Brand's Fame\nThese days, brands that aim to succeed can no longer rely solely on advertising. Building brand awareness and owning media space are key to keeping a brand top of mind for customers. This is why\n\"Share of Voice (SOV)\"\nhas become a key metric that marketers worldwide prioritize. If your brand is just a small voice drowned out by the larger competitors, it will be hard for customers to remember and choose you over other brands. Many brands, therefore, choose to collaborate with a specialized\ndigital marketing agency\nto strategize and maximize their SOV effectively.\nWhat is Share of Voice (SOV)?\nShare of Voice (SOV) refers to the proportion of communication your brand has compared to competitors in the market. It calculates how much your brand is present or communicating with consumers through various channels compared to others in the same industry. This can be measured through several communication channels, such as:\nPaid Media:\nThe percentage of your advertising budget spent on paid media compared to competitors in the same industry. Investment in these media channels reflects your brand's ability to reach consumers through paid platforms.\nOwned Media:\nThe number of website visits or engagement on your brand’s social media, such as likes, shares, or comments on your posts. This engagement helps measure how your brand is interacting with and responding to customers.\nEarned Media:\nThe number of articles, reviews, or mentions of your brand in the media or by consumers without any paid promotion. Mentions in the press or reviews from consumers contribute to building credibility and increasing brand recognition in the market.\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Search Visibility:\nThe share of visibility in search engine results, like Google, when people search for terms related to your brand or product. This measure shows how frequently your brand appears in search results compared to competitors in the same industry.\nThe Importance of Share of Voice\nMeasuring Share of Voice (SOV) is not just about gaining an overview of a brand's communication in the market but also holds significance in various aspects that can be applied to improve marketing strategies effectively. These include:\nAssessing the Brand's Market Position\nCalculating SOV helps a brand understand its position relative to competitors. A high SOV means that your brand has better communication and visibility in the market, which reflects the strength of the brand in terms of marketing and creating awareness among the target audience.\nReflecting Growth Opportunities\nStudies have shown that brands with a higher SOV compared to their competitors tend to have greater growth potential in the market. A higher SOV allows brands to increase their market share (Share of Market, or SOM) at a faster rate.\nEnabling More Accurate Marketing Strategy Planning\nHaving clear SOV data allows a brand to plan its marketing strategies more effectively. For instance, analyzing SOV can help a brand decide where to increase its advertising budget or how to adjust its SEO strategy to improve visibility in Google search results. Additionally, it can assist in deciding how to create content or campaigns that generate more engagement from the target audience.\nHow to Calculate Share of Voice\nShare of Voice = (Brand Reach / Total Market Reach) × 100\nFor example, let’s assume Brand A (your brand) competes with Brands B and C in the same market, and you want to calculate the SOV for Brand A in this market.\nData used for calculation:\nBrand A Reach = 50,000 (e.g., website visits, mentions in media and ads)\nBrand B Reach = 40,000\nBrand C Reach = 30,000\nTotal Market Reach = Brand A + Brand B + Brand C = 50,000 + 40,000 + 30,000 = 120,000\nSOV Calculation:\nShare of Voice = (50,000 / 120,000) × 100 = 41.67%\nFrom this calculation, Brand A will have an SOV of 41.67%, meaning your brand has 41.67% of the communication and visibility in the market compared to the two competing brands. This SOV value helps you assess your brand’s position in the market and refine your marketing strategy accordingly.\n﻿\nHow to Increase Share of Voice to Enhance Brand Recognition\nMaximize advertising budget\nInvesting in advertising plays a crucial role in increasing SOV. Strategies like Programmatic Advertising or Targeted Ads help enhance efficiency by reaching specific target groups, reducing advertising costs, and maximizing results. This approach ensures that the brand appears in the right places and attracts more attention.\nCreate high-quality content that appeals to the target audience\nDeveloping high-quality content that resonates with the target audience can significantly boost engagement and brand mentions. For example, creating engaging video content or utilizing influencer marketing to promote the brand can create a larger impact.\nLeverage social media\nSocial media is a powerful tool for increasing SOV. Posting content that aligns with consumer interests, responding to inquiries, and interacting with followers help increase engagement and strengthen the connection between the brand and its audience.\nImprove website ranking in search results using effective SEO techniques\nSEO is another critical strategy to boost SOV. By optimizing website content and using keywords relevant to the target audience, a brand can increase its visibility and ranking in Google search results. Higher visibility leads to increased reach among the target audience.\nEncourage earned media\nEarned media, such as product reviews on blogs, customer experiences shared on social media, or word-of-mouth recommendations, helps create widespread awareness and builds trust in the brand. Encouraging positive mentions through the media or customer experiences can sustainably increase SOV.\nShare of Voice is an important metric for marketing strategies as it helps brands understand their position in the market and serves as a guide to adjust strategies for increasing visibility and market share. Increasing SOV doesn't always mean spending more money, but rather using the right strategies to achieve effective results. This is why many brands choose to consult with an experienced\ndigital marketing agency\nto plan the most cost-effective use of their budget and resources.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\n9 MrBeast-Style Video Marketing Tricks for Viral Content\nTechnology\nMarketing\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n341\n0\nBreaking Down MrBeast’s Videos Formula for Viral Content\nAs consumers spend hours each day on video platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Video, video marketing has become a critical strategy for businesses of all sizes. Among the most successful examples of viral video creation is “MrBeast,” a YouTube content creator with over 200 million subscribers worldwide. His structured, methodical approach to content production offers valuable lessons that can be effectively adapted for Thai businesses and beyond.\n9 Strategies for Making MrBeast-Style Video Marketing to Maximize Viral Potential\n1. A Great Video Isn't Just Visually Appealing — It Must Be Watched Until the End\nOne of the core principles behind how MrBeast makes videos is maximizing the \"Retention Rate,\" or the percentage of viewers who watch until the end. Attractive visuals and clear audio are not enough; videos must be designed to captivate and sustain audience interest throughout.\nA key tip is to identify moments where viewers are likely to drop off and restructure the video to ensure that the beginning and middle sections are the strongest, keeping audiences engaged for as long as possible.\n2. Titles and Thumbnails Matter More Than You Think\nWhen it comes to MrBeast videos, the importance of the \"Title\" and \"Thumbnail\" cannot be overstated. These elements are the first impressions that determine whether someone clicks or scrolls past.\nEffective strategies include crafting emotionally charged, story-driven titles—such as transforming “Trying to Stay in Front of a House for 50 Hours” into “Challenge Accepted! Surviving 50 Hours Outside My House!”—and designing eye-catching thumbnails that accurately reflect the video’s content to maintain credibility.\n3. The Golden Minute: Hook Viewers in the First 60 Seconds\nAccording to MrBeast's team, the sharpest drop-off in viewership occurs within the first minute. To succeed, make videos like MrBeast by starting with a bang—whether it's a surprising event, a provocative question, or diving straight into the action within the first 60 seconds. Failing to captivate viewers early drastically reduces overall video performance.\n4. Re-Engage Every Three Minutes\nEffective video marketing requires building in “Re-Engagement Points” roughly every three minutes. This could include plot twists, unexpected reveals, or humorous moments—techniques frequently seen in MrBeast videos. Regularly rekindling viewer interest is crucial to maintaining attention until the video’s conclusion.\n5. Create a Unique \"WOW Factor\" That Can't Be Imitated\nWhat sets MrBeast videos apart is their unreplicable \"WOW Factor\"—whether it’s lifting an entire house with a crane or giving away half a million dollars in a simple game.\nBrands can adapt this approach by launching unique campaigns that break industry norms, such as unexpected product giveaways or surprising collaborations with influencers.\n6. Creativity Beats Expensive Gear\nOne vital insight from how MrBeast makes videos is that creativity outweighs equipment quality. The MrBeast team focuses on developing fresh ideas rather than relying on professional-grade gear. A compelling story will always outperform the mere use of expensive cameras. In short: don’t let technical limitations hinder creativity.\n7. Know Exactly What Moment You’re Filming\nEvery piece of content produced by MrBeast undergoes meticulous structural planning. Teams know exactly what minute or second of the video they are shooting, allowing them to tailor tone, pacing, and excitement levels to audience expectations. For example:\nMinute 1: Peak excitement\nMinutes 1–3: Rapid storytelling\nMinutes 3–6: Quick scene changes to sustain momentum\nMinute 6 onward: Big reveals and an unforgettable finale\n8. Never Leave Critical Tasks Unsupervised\nOne of MrBeast’s golden rules is: Never assume others will handle critical tasks with the same care you would. Whether it’s equipment preparation, shooting logistics, or backup planning, creators must personally oversee all key details to ensure seamless execution. This principle applies to all levels of video marketing—thorough involvement is non-negotiable.\n9. Rethink Product Placement: From \"Inserting Ads\" to \"Building Content Together\"\nAnother secret behind the success of MrBeast videos is how seamlessly brands are integrated into the story, rather than feeling like disruptive ads.\nExamples include making a brand part of a major prize giveaway or incorporating a sponsor’s product naturally into a challenge. Instead of traditional, overt advertising, the brand becomes an engaging and organic element of the video itself.\nWhile few businesses have resources comparable to MrBeast, understanding viewer behavior and intelligently structuring content can significantly boost performance.\nToday’s video marketing landscape isn’t about the most expensive cameras or biggest production budgets—it’s about knowing your audience and telling stories that resonate in the shortest time possible.\nIf your business is looking for guidance or a team of experts to help plan this kind of impactful content strategy, consulting with a professional\ndigital marketing agency\nthat specializes in video strategy is an excellent way to take your campaigns further than you ever imagined!\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",
