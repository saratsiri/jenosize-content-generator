So, regardless of which aspect of life, we must always be prepared to cope with these changes, especially for entrepreneurs striving for business success.\nToday, let's explore \"\nMegatrends\n,\" which are global-level trends that both marketers and the global population must understand!\nWhat are Megatrends?\nMegatrends are global-scale waves of change that impact every aspect of life. They often occur slowly but have lasting and far-reaching effects. These megatrends are driven by various factors such as technology, society, economy, environment, and more.\nWhy Should Businesses Prioritize Megatrends 2024?\nBusinesses need to prioritize megatrends because these trends are significant factors that impact business operations in various aspects. Here's why:\nStrategic Planning\n: Megatrends provide organizations with an overview of major changes that will occur in the future, enabling them to analyze opportunities and challenges. This helps in devising suitable strategies and adapting promptly.\nProduct and Service Development\n: Understanding customer needs that evolve with Megatrends allows organizations to develop products and services that are relevant and contemporary.\nResource Management\n: Key megatrends such as aging societies and social/environmental changes affect resource management practices such as human resource management, energy management, and sustainable development.\nCompetitive Adaptation\n: Megatrends may introduce new competitors or new competition formats. So, organizations need to closely monitor trends to maintain competitiveness.\nBuilding Trust\n: Prioritizing Megatrends demonstrates an organization's vision and responsibility towards society and the environment, building trust and acceptance among stakeholders.\nIn conclusion, tracking, analyzing, and prioritizing megatrends 2024 is crucial for organizations to effectively plan and adapt to significant changes.\n7 Megatrends for 2024 That Are Worth Noting\n1. Urbanization\nThe world's population continues to migrate towards cities at an increasing rate. Current statistics show that more than half of the world's population resides in urban areas, and it is projected to increase to 68% by 2050. This trend results in densely populated megacities that must cope with challenges such as housing, traffic, pollution, and social inequality. Hence, there is a necessity for modernized infrastructure, efficient public transportation, and proper urban planning to ensure a high quality of life for citizens.\n2. Climate Change\nThe world is currently facing increasingly severe effects of global warming, impacting the environment, economy, and society significantly. Many countries are now prioritizing reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to clean energy, and adopting more environmentally-friendly production and consumption practices, such as reducing plastic usage, utilizing recyclable packaging, and practicing organic farming.\n3. Shifting Economic Power\nIn recent years, there has been a significant shift in the global economy, especially with the rapid growth of developing countries like China, India, and Singapore, while developed economies experience a slowdown. This shift necessitates businesses to adapt their strategies, such as expanding into growing economies and innovating to enhance competitiveness.\n4. Growing Sustainability\nWith various changes occurring, many businesses have realized the necessity of reducing their environmental impact. They integrate sustainable development concepts into their operations, from production to services and supply chains, to ensure long-term quality growth. For example, leading cosmetics and skincare companies are reformulating products to be organic and cruelty-free to meet the preferences of modern consumers, enabling organizations to sustainably grow.\n5. Aging Society\nThe population is aging, coupled with a decreasing trend in childbirth, leading to the emergence of aging societies worldwide. This trend impacts healthcare systems, social security, and the demand for products and services related to elderly care, such as tourism, residential facilities, and various amenities. This trend requires attention from modern businesses.\n6. Digital Lifestyle\nDigital technology plays an increasingly significant role in daily life, transforming various aspects such as work, education, shopping, and services onto online platforms. This necessitates businesses to adapt and develop digital channels to provide convenience and meet customer demands, remaining competitive in the digital age.\n7. Industry 5.0: Human-AI Collaboration\nAI technology is increasingly integrated into industries to enhance efficiency in production and services. This requires both employees to adapt their skills to work alongside AI systems and businesses to invest in AI to elevate their production standards, meeting the demands of digital consumers.\nIt can be said that megatrends 2024 acts as a compass, guiding businesses towards a smoother path to the future.

So, integrating online and offline marketing channels, known as O2O (Online to Offline) Marketing, is something not to be overlooked. By focusing on providing excellent\ncustomer experiences (CX)\n, businesses can stand out from competitors, even if they operate within the same industry.\nWhat is Customer Experience (CX)?\nCustomer Experience (CX) is the entirety of experiences that customers receive from interacting with a brand, product, or service,\nstarting from before the purchase, during the purchase, and after the purchase. CX encompasses every touchpoint between the customer and the brand, whether it's advertising, sales, customer service, product usage, or even communication through various online and offline media.\nIn this regard, the key components of customer experience are creating experiences that are impressive, convenient, and valuable to customers in order to foster brand loyalty and stimulate repeat purchases in the future. So, creating CX is considered a crucial key to competing in the era of Marketing 5.0.\nWhy is it Important to Create a Blended CX Between Online and Offline channels?\nCurrently, consumer behavior has shifted towards more diverse channels for brand interaction and purchasing, whether it be online or offline. Therefore, creating a blended customer experience across these two channels is crucial for the following reasons:\nMeeting the needs of modern consumers\nwho lead a blended lifestyle between the online and offline worlds, resulting in smoother and more convenient purchasing experiences for products or services.\nFostering strong relationships with customers\nas brands can consistently engage with customers both online and offline, leading to tighter bonds with customers.\nEnhancing sales and marketing efficiency\nby leveraging data from various channels to analyze and improve strategies to better meet customer needs.\nSetting oneself apart and standing out from competitors\nby offering seamless and comprehensive experiences across all channels, while other competitors may prioritize only one channel.\nIncreasing profit opportunities and building customer loyalty\nas customers who have positive experiences both online and offline are more likely to be impressed, leading to repeat purchases and word-of-mouth recommendations to others.\n5 Techniques for Integrating Online and Offline Customer Experience\nKnow Your Customers\nGathering Demographic Data, Lifestyle Patterns, Purchasing Behaviors, and Preferences of Target Audiences from Both Online and Offline Channels\nAnalyze the collected data to gain deep understanding of customers, including their needs, current challenges, strengths, weaknesses, etc.\nUtilize the information to strategize marketing efforts and create experiences that best resonate with customers.\nDeliver a Seamless Cross-Channel Experience\nMerge online and in-store purchasing channels smoothly, including product information, post-sale services, payment processes, etc.\nProvide convenience for customers to initiate purchases from one channel and seamlessly transition to another. For example, customers can browse products online, reserve them, then pay in-store, or they can try products in-store and later order them online.\nIntegrate customer databases between the two channels so that sales staff can access customer purchase history anywhere.\nHarnessing Technology Benefits\nUtilize AI to analyze customer data such as preferences, purchase history, and provide tailored product recommendations accurately.\nLeverage the\nMetaverse\nand AR/VR to create exciting shopping experiences, making it feel like customers are physically in the store while browsing through their mobile screens.\nAllow customers to try on clothes or view products through AR/VR both online and in-store.\nOrganize special events\non the Metaverse for customers to participate in new and innovative formats.\nEmphasizing Personalized Marketing\nUtilize data from all platforms to deeply understand each customer, then tailor content, promotions, and experiences to match individual preferences and needs.\nSend email notifications or special offers before appointments or after purchases to foster customer engagement.\nTrain staff to provide personalized care for customers both online and offline.\nSelling offline and Building Online Relationships\nEncourage customers who visit the store to engage with the brand online, such as signing up for newsletters or receiving special promotions via email or SMS.\nCreate marketing campaigns targeting customers who have visited the store before to maintain customer loyalty and stimulate repeat purchases.\nUtilize online channels to gather feedback on satisfaction after in-store purchases, then use this feedback to improve and develop the store further.\nCase Study\nCurrently, many businesses are increasingly adopting O2O marketing strategies to meet the needs of modern consumers, and a significant number of them have achieved success by creating seamless customer experiences between online and offline channels. In this article, we will showcase the \"\nDEmark Award\n,\" a competition that integrates both channels effectively.\nThe DEmark Award is bestowed upon Thai products with excellent designs, organized by the Department of International Trade Promotion, Ministry of Commerce.

    "content": "<\nBack\nBrand Building Strategies Without Relying on Marketplaces\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n12\n0\nThe Brand Building Process Beyond Marketplaces\nMany people believe the goal of online marketing is simply to drive sales — and while that’s not wrong, anyone running a business knows that the first sale is just the beginning of a much more important, long-term journey. In today’s world where customers have endless choices, success isn’t about who sells first — it’s about who can make customers come back again and again.\nSelling on marketplaces may help you gain new customers today, but if they don’t return tomorrow, your business ends up starting from scratch every day. The real question is: wouldn’t it be better to have a system where every click, every order, and every referral contributes to long-term customer relationships — automatically?\nWhy Relying Solely on Marketplaces Could Be Holding Back Your Brand Building Success\nCommission Fees Up to 20–30%\nOne of the biggest hidden costs of marketplace selling is the high commission and platform fees. Some platforms take as much as 30% of your total sales revenue. This significantly reduces your profit per item, leaving less to invest in product development or future branding strategies.\nNo Access to Customer Data\nA major limitation of selling on marketplaces is that you don’t get direct access to customer data like emails, phone numbers, or purchasing behavior. Yet, this information is essential in the brand building process, helping you tailor communication, launch personalized campaigns, and improve customer retention.\nLimited Ability to Build Long-Term Customer Relationships\nMarketplace sales don’t align with core branding principles, as you’re essentially “renting space” on someone else’s platform. This prevents your brand from forming emotional bonds with customers or delivering the kind of personalized experience that fosters loyalty.\nEasy for Customers to Switch to Competitors\nWithout a unique brand experience or value proposition, marketplace customers often compare solely on price. If a competitor offers a lower price, they’ll easily win the sale. This is a critical risk for brands that haven’t yet built strong identity or differentiation.\nWhat Is a Loyalty Program — and Why Do Modern Businesses Need One?\nIn today’s competitive branding landscape, creating deep customer connections is key. One of the most effective tools in the brand building process is a loyalty program — a reward system offering points, perks, and exclusive benefits to repeat customers.\nReduce Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)\nAcquiring a new customer costs up to five times more than retaining an existing one. Investing in a Loyalty Program helps encourage repeat purchases, significantly lowering your overall acquisition costs.\nIncrease Average Order Value (AOV)\nWhen customers feel that “the more they buy, the more they benefit,” they naturally tend to spend more. Well-designed point systems and member-only promotions incentivize larger purchases — without feeling like a hard sell.\nBoost Repeat Purchases\nThe ultimate goal of brand building is creating a loyal customer base. A Loyalty Program keeps your brand top-of-mind, driving repeat purchases through rewards that offer both emotional and tangible value.\nEnhance Word-of-Mouth Marketing\nHappy customers who feel valued by your brand often become advocates — sharing their experience with friends and family. This type of word-of-mouth marketing is more trustworthy than traditional ads and helps expand your customer base at a lower cost.\nEverydayCustomer: The Modern Business Solution for Brand Building\nIn an age where marketplaces charge 20–30% commissions and limit access to customer data, building your own platform is one of smart and sustainable branding principles.\nEverydayCustomer is an all-in-one platform built to help Thai SMEs shift away from marketplace dependency and toward managing their own branded storefront\n— consolidating all essential business tools in one place:\nUX-first Website Builder:\nCreate a seamless online storefront with inventory, coupon, and order management — no coding required.\nTiered & Subscription-Based Loyalty System:\nEncourage repeat purchases and increase brand loyalty through customizable membership benefits and reward tiers.\nLINE, Facebook, IG, and TikTok Integration:\nCombine all your social channels into one platform, enabling seamless omnichannel commerce experiences.\nReferral Program:\nLet customers refer friends via QR codes or custom links and reward them with exclusive discounts or gifts.\nAI-Generated SEO Content:\nSave time on content creation with AI that automatically writes SEO-friendly product descriptions, promotions, and blog posts.\nOne-Page Checkout:\nSimplify the buying process and increase conversion rates with a fast, user-friendly checkout experience that supports QR payments and credit cards.\nOnline–Offline Customer Data Sync:\nCapture customer data both in-store and online, allowing for precise marketing plans and data-driven brand building decisions.\nIn today’s world, sales aren’t just numbers on a dashboard — they’re the starting point for meaningful, long-term relationships. Businesses that truly grow aren’t just good at selling — they’re good at understanding their customers and making them want to come back.\nSustainable branding doesn’t come from chasing new customers every day, but from delivering great experiences to the ones you already have. That’s where smart loyalty systems, engaging reward programs, and valuable referrals come into play.\nEverydayCustomer is designed to be more than just a website builder — it’s a\ntech solution for businesses\nto build long-term profitability.\nIt’s time to build sales that don’t disappear into thin air — and customer loyalty that lasts beyond the first purchase.

The more an event can impress attendees to the point where they feel like they “don’t want to leave,” the clearer the signal that the brand has delivered a quality experience.\nThis kind of success doesn’t happen by chance. It’s the result of intentional planning, design, and meticulous attention to every detail of the event experience—anchored in what’s known as a\nsensory experience\n. Here’s how leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates who keep coming back for more.\nWhat Is a Sensory Experience?\nA sensory experience refers to a marketing approach that engages the human senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions.\nBy appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments that foster deep emotional engagement and personal connection.\nBrands that master the art of crafting sensory experiences don’t just make an impression—they embed themselves in memory. It’s not just about awareness; it’s about emotion and attachment. This depth of connection is what fuels long-term brand loyalty and drives organic word of mouth.\n7 Sensory Experience Techniques for Designing Unforgettable Event Experiences\n1. Stimulate Sight\n\"Attract from the first glance with a design that reflects your brand identity.\"\nVisual presentation is the gateway to your brand’s universe. Elements like spatial design, lighting, brand colors, logos, and stage visuals should clearly reflect the brand image. Using brand-consistent color palettes, lighting that complements the mood, and Instagram-worthy photo spots can organically boost online sharing and visibility.\n2. Engage Taste\n\"A great taste lingers longer than any words.\"\nFood and beverages aren’t just refreshments—they’re storytelling tools. Curate menus that align with your event’s theme, incorporate local flavors to set the scene, or even develop signature drinks and treats that reflect your brand identity. Each bite becomes an extension of your brand narrative.\n3. Evoke Memory Through Smell\n\"Scent is the most powerful trigger of memory.\"\nScents have a surprising influence on mood and memory. Pleasant aromas throughout your event space can induce calmness, luxury, or energy. Align your fragrance strategy with the event theme—for example, lavender for wellness events or citrus scents for energizing environments.\n4. Enliven the Atmosphere with Sound\n\"The right sound sets the right mood.\"\nFrom playlists to ambient noise to human chatter, sound shapes the entire event experience. Choose music that fits the theme, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound design for product reveals. Every sound element should contribute to the overall sensory experience.\n5. Activate Touch\n\"Tactile experiences create lasting impressions.\"\nTouch adds a tangible dimension to your brand. Use textured materials in decor, offer hands-on product demos, or provide custom-designed giveaways. DIY or workshop zones are also effective, encouraging attendees to engage physically and emotionally with your brand.\n6. Tap into Emotion\n\"When the heart feels, the brand stays.\"\nEmotional engagement transforms experiences. Encourage attendees to share personal stories, use uplifting or inspiring content, or tell your brand’s story through short films. Emotionally charged moments—pride, joy, inspiration—convert passive guests into brand advocates.\n7. Add Meaning Through Spirit\n\"Brands with purpose make a deeper impact.\"\nTrue impact comes when experiences reflect the brand’s deeper values and mission. Include social impact initiatives, tie into environmental or cultural causes, or create space for guests to share dreams and beliefs. Let every moment mean more than just “fun”—make it meaningful.\nCase Study: Brands That Successfully Used Sensory Experience to Win Over Audiences\nIncorporating the sensory experience model in event planning doesn’t just create fleeting impressions. It can shift consumer behavior, boost conversions, and build lasting brand recognition. Here are two success stories that prove its effectiveness:\nTraveloka: Engaging Travelers with Limited Space\nAs the travel industry began recovering post-COVID-19, regional platform Traveloka sought to reignite interest among travelers. With just a 30-square-meter booth in a high-traffic Bangkok mall, they partnered with Jenosize to run an activation campaign. Activities included mini-games, discount giveaways, and celebrity photo ops—maximizing impact within tight spatial constraints.\nResults:\nOver 200 attendees per day during the 3-day event\nSignificant lift in brand recall and online deal redemptions\nMRT Purple Line: Redefining Public Perception\nDuring the launch of Bangkok’s MRT Purple Line, the brand aimed to create a positive image despite fare concerns. Using both online and offline event strategies focused on sensory experiences, they successfully shifted customer perception.\nResults:\nRebranded as “A New Year’s Gift” for commuters\n70% increase in ridership during the campaign\nPassengers began recognizing the long-term value and quality of the service\nIn a world where brands compete through experience rather than advertising, creating events that make attendees “never want to leave” becomes a competitive advantage. These seven techniques go beyond aesthetics—they foster emotional connection and long-term brand loyalty.\nIf your business is looking for an\nevent management company\nthat understands experiential strategy and knows how to truly engage your audience,\nJenosize\nis your ideal partner.

However, there is a fascinating\nmarketing\nphenomenon that explains the opposite of what should be happening. This is known as the\n\"lipstick effect\"\ntheory, which describes the tendency of consumers to continue purchasing small luxury items even during poor economic conditions.\nWhat is the Lipstick Effect?\nThe lipstick effect is an economic theory that explains consumer behavior during economic downturns. It observes that consumers, especially women, tend to continue buying affordable luxury items such as lipstick, cosmetics, accessories, etc., even when they have to economize in other areas. This phenomenon demonstrates that even during tough economic times, people still desire small pleasures and positive feelings from purchasing items that make them feel better about themselves.\nThe History of the Lipstick Effect\nThe concept of the lipstick effect was first introduced by Leonard Lauder, the chairman of Estée Lauder Companies, in 2001. He observed that the company's lipstick sales increased significantly after the 9/11 events, a period when the U.S. economy was facing difficulties. Subsequently, this concept gained widespread attention and was subjected to in-depth studies by economists and marketers worldwide.\nHowever, a similar phenomenon had been observed even earlier. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, lipstick sales also increased surprisingly. This demonstrates that the phenomenon is rooted in deep-seated human behavior and has recurred throughout history.\nReasons Behind the Lipstick Effect\nNeed for Confidence\nDuring times of economic uncertainty, people often feel insecure and seek ways to boost their confidence. The solution lies in purchasing affordable cosmetics or beauty products, as these can help elevate self-worth and increase confidence without spending as much as on larger luxury items.\nChanging Spending Patterns\nWhen the economy is poor, consumers tend to reduce spending on large, expensive items such as houses or cars. As a result, they turn to small luxuries for happiness, as these provide a sense of fulfillment without requiring significant expenditure.\nIncreased Emotional Value\nDuring difficult times, small items like lipstick or perfume may have a greater emotional impact. They help consumers feel better when facing stress from economic uncertainty. Purchasing these items is like giving oneself a reward at an affordable price.\nSocial Mimicry\nEven in tough economic times, people still want to maintain their social image. Therefore, buying affordable beauty or fashion items allows them to feel part of social trends and fashion without overspending.\nThe Impact of the Lipstick Effect on Economy and Business\nBusiness Adaptation\nCompanies, especially in the beauty and fashion industries, often adjust their marketing strategies to respond to the lipstick effect. They may focus on producing smaller or more affordable items to attract consumers seeking small pleasures during economic downturns.\nBusiness Risk Diversification\nCompanies with diverse product lines may leverage the lipstick effect by emphasizing the marketing of more affordable products to compensate for declining sales of expensive items.\nCreation of New Business Opportunities\nThe lipstick effect may lead to the emergence of new businesses that focus on producing small luxury items or affordable luxuries to meet consumer demands during economic recessions.\nMaintaining Economic Stability\nAlthough small in scale, the lipstick effect can help maintain money circulation in the economic system, potentially alleviating some impacts of economic recession.\nLong-term Changes in Consumer Behavior\nThe lipstick effect may result in long-term changes in consumer behavior, with consumers tending to place more importance on the value and cost-effectiveness of products, even after the economy recovers.\nExamples of the Lipstick Effect in Thailand\nDuring periods of economic difficulty in Thailand\n, such as after the Tom Yum Kung crisis in 1997 or during the economic slowdown from 2017-2019, it was observed that female consumers showed increased interest in beauty products. According to a 2017 report by Kasikorn Research Center, the value of the cosmetics market in Thailand continued to grow by 6.5%, amounting to 168 billion baht. The facial product group, including lipsticks, had a high growth rate of 8%.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand\n, which severely impacted the economy, many consumers chose to invest in skincare products for face and body, even while being more cautious about spending in other areas. Data from Euromonitor International reported that in 2020, the skincare product market in Thailand was valued at 47,700 million baht, growing 1.8% from the previous year, despite the overall economy contracting by 6.1%.\nThe lipstick effect is considered an interesting and important phenomenon in economics and marketing. Although it occurs during economic downturns, it demonstrates that consumers still desire small luxury items that can make them feel better. Understanding this phenomenon helps businesses adjust their marketing strategies and operations to align with consumer behavior in uncertain economic conditions. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of happiness and confidence in consumers' lives, which should not be overlooked even during economic recessions.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

One of the powerful digital technologies emerging this year is \"\nSpatial Computing\n\" and \"\nImmersive Technology\n,\" some of which are already being utilized by brands to create new opportunities. Whether it's creating captivating shopping experiences or offering personalized products and services, these technologies are leaving a lasting impression on customers, ultimately leading to increased revenue and long-term brand loyalty.\nLet's delve deeper into both of these technologies and understand how incorporating these innovations can make retail businesses more efficient, contemporary, and stand out from the competition.\nWhat is Spatial Computing?\nSpatial Computing is the processing of spatial data\n, a technology that merges the virtual world with the real world by creating digital environments and objects. In this digital format, everything in the real world, whether it's users, objects, or environments, can interact seamlessly with digital counterparts.\nWhat is Immersive Technology?\nImmersive Technology simulates a comprehensive\n, lifelike experience by drawing users into a virtual environment, created through a combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. This immersive experience encompasses visuals, sounds, and various sensory perceptions. A common example is VR headsets that transport wearers into entirely different environments, distinct from their physical surroundings, providing a fully immersive experience. A recent example is the Apple Vision Pro glasses, which represent Apple's first foray into spatial computing glasses, offering users an advanced immersive experience.\nImplementing Spatial Computing & Immersive Technology in Retail Stores\nRetail businesses can leverage Spatial Computing & Immersive Technology in various ways. Some common examples of their usage include:\nAllowing Customers to Virtually Try Products\nRetailers of clothing, shoes, jewelry, or cosmetics can utilize these innovations to enable customers to virtually try products before making a purchase decision. For instance, customers can try on clothes virtually without having to remove their current attire, or experiment with makeup looks without using actual cosmetics. This can be achieved through Computer Vision systems, leveraging techniques like machine learning and deep learning to track positions and movements, detect faces, and differentiate objects, coupled with AR technology.\nIn-Store Navigation\nFor larger retail outlets with a vast array of products, AR technology can be employed to create a 3D map of the store, allowing customers to easily and quickly locate items. Additionally, 3D scanning technology can be utilized to create a three-dimensional model of the interior space, including the positioning of products and various fixtures. This information can then be stored as digital data on a cloud-based system.\nAutomatic Payment Processing\nCustomers can make payments automatically without relying on cashiers, a feature already observed in retail businesses in China and the United States. This technology enhances convenience and reduces waiting times for customers. Key technologies utilized include facial recognition and identity verification systems, seamlessly linking to user accounts and payment information for swift transaction processing.\nDistant Shopping Experience\nBusinesses can utilize VR technology to offer customers a virtual shopping experience without the need to physically visit the store. This goes beyond traditional online shopping, as it immerses customers in a virtual representation of the store, even while they're at home placing orders. It's another avenue to create a memorable experience for customers, making them feel as if they're truly inside the store, even when they're just browsing from the comfort of their homes.\nThe Benefits of Utilizing Spatial Computing and Immersive Tech in Retail Stores\nCreating Memorable Customer Experiences\nThese technologies add a new dimension to the shopping experience for customers by allowing them to see, hear, and feel products virtually before making a purchase decision. When customers have a positive experience, it fosters a stronger connection with the business, ultimately leading to increased loyalty in the long run.\nEnhancing Sales Efficiency\nRetailers can present products in more detailed and engaging ways, reducing limitations in space and time for selling products and services. Additionally, they can provide more personalized recommendations tailored to customer needs, encouraging customers to return for repeat purchases.\nFacilitating Accurate Data Analysis\nAI technology enables business owners to gather detailed and comprehensive data on customer purchasing behaviors by tracking user interactions with the digital products we create. This information can then be analyzed to develop marketing strategies that are even more effective in the future.\nIncreasing Cross-Selling Opportunities\nFor instance, a customer may initially intend to buy a specific shirt, but when they try it on through virtual reality, the system may suggest a skirt that complements the shirt perfectly. If the customer likes how the outfit looks when they try it on, there's a greater chance of selling both items than just the initially intended purchase. This not only simplifies product recommendations but also boosts sales simultaneously.\nAdopting spatial computing and immersive tech intelligently can elevate experiences for both businesses and customers. Customers can engage with products and shop in novel ways, leading to informed purchase decisions and long-term brand loyalty. Simultaneously, businesses can modernize their image, becoming memorable leaders in future innovation. However, it's crucial to prioritize customer privacy, obtaining consent for data collection and usage transparently to build trust.\nTo accelerate your business's success in the virtual world, our\nBrandverse\nservice can guide your business into the era of marketing 5.0 comprehensively and efficiently.

    "title": "Oligopoly Market: Is Selling Easier with Fewer Competitors?",

    "content": "<\nBack\nOligopoly Market: Is Selling Easier with Fewer Competitors?\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n867\n0\nOligopoly Market: Fewer Competitors Doesn't Mean It's Easier\nIn the past, monopoly markets dominated the busines\ns world. However, with stricter antitrust laws, large businesses began to break apart, giving rise to the oligopoly market—where o\nnly a few sellers dominate.\nMany people might think that having only a few competitors means more\nbusiness opportunities\n, but in reality, the opposite is true! When the market is divided among just a few major players, competition intensifies significantly, with enormous budgets, complex strategies, and endless investments in innovation.\nLet’s first understand: What is an Oligopoly Market?\nAn oligopoly market, or a ma\nrket with few sellers, is a market structure dominated by only a small number of large companies.\nTypically, there are at least two players but no more than ten. Each company holds a significant market share, so the decisions and business strategies of each player have a considerable impact on the overall market.\nAnother key characteristic of\nan oligopoly market is that each company often has some power to set prices and control production levels. However, they cannot make these decisions entirely on their own, as they must consider potential reactions from other competitors. Additionally, entering an oligopoly market in Thailand\ncan be challenging due to several obstacles, including high capital investment requirements, the need for specialized technology or expertise, and regulatory constraints or licensing requirements.\nInteresting Examples of Oligopoly Markets in Thailand and the Challenges Each Industry Faces\nIn Thailand, there are several industries with an oligopoly market structure, where only a few major players dominate the market. Each of these industries fa\nces unique challenges and competition. Here are some examples of oligopoly markets:\nThai Beer Market\nThe Thai beer market is a clear example of an oligopoly, with only a few key players, led by Boon Rawd Brewery (Singha) and Thai Beverage (Chang), which together control over 90% of the market share. A major challenge in this industry is the strict legal regulations, including advertising restrictions, production permits, and distribution laws, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to break into the market.\nAirline Industry\nThe airline market in Thailand is also oligopolistic, with a few major players like Thai Airways, Thai AirAsia, Nok Air, and Thai Lion Air competing intensely. The challenges they face include high operating costs, such as fuel prices, aircraft maintenance, and fleet investments. Additionally, external factors like the COVID-19 crisis have had a severe impact on the aviation industry.\nE-Commerce Platforms\nAlthough relatively new, the e-commerce market in Thailand also shows oligopoly characteristics. Major players like Shopee, Lazada, and JD Central dominate the competition. The main challenges in this industry include massive investments in logistics infrastructure, high marketing costs, building consumer trust, and retaining customers in the face of fierce competition.\nMobile Telecommunications Market\nThe telecommunications market in Thailand is controlled by three major providers: AIS, DTAC, and TRUE. Each of these companies must invest heavily in infrastructure, including signal towers, frequency auctions, and the development of 5G technology. Major challenges include intense price competition, maintaining service quality, and generating additional revenue from digital services.\nFood Delivery Apps\nThe food delivery app market in Thailand is dominated by Grab, foodpanda, and LINE MAN, which compete fiercely with each other. The challenges in this industry involve balancing revenue and costs, maintaining service quality, managing riders, and competing with high-cost promotions. Moreover, continuous technological development is necessary to enhance service efficiency.\nWhy Do Businesses in an Oligopoly Market Have to Invest More Than Expected?\nMany people might think that doing business in an oligopoly market (with few sellers) is easier than in a competitive market. However, the reality is quite the opposite. The oligopoly market comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore why this is the case:\nHigh Barriers to Entry\nThe reason there are only a few sellers in a\nn oligopoly market is not th\nat no one wants to enter, but because there are many obstacles to entry. Some of these include:\nMassive Initial Investment:\nFor example, in the telecommunications business, companies need to invest in networks, signal towers, and frequency auctions, which can cost billions of baht.\nContinuous Investment in Technology and Innovation:\nBusinesses must constantly invest in technology development, such as the 5G rollout in telecommunications or platform development in e-commerce.\nRegulatory Requirements:\nCompanies must secure licenses, pass standard inspections, and comply with strict regulations. This process involves both time and money.\nIntense Competition\nAlthough there are few players in the market, the competition\nin an oligopoly market is o\nften fiercer than in typical markets because:\nIntense Marketing Competition:\nBusinesses must allocate enormous budgets for advertising and promotions. For example, food delivery platforms continuously offer discounts and promotions to stay competitive.\nConstant Product and Service Development:\nCompanies must always invest in developing new products and services to maintain a competitive edge.\nMarket Share Maintenance:\nAs market share increases, companies must invest more resources to retain their customer base.\nHigher Consumer Expectations Than in Competitive Markets\nBeing a major player in the market means dealing with higher consumer expectations, including:\nService Standards:\nConsumers expect premium services, such as in the airline industry, where safety and high-level customer service standards must be maintained at all times.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\nCompanies need to invest in CSR activities and build a positive corporate image.\nCrisis Management:\nWhen issues arise, consumers expect quick and effective resolutions, such as when a bank's system crashes or mobile signals are disrupted.\nBeing a player in an oligopoly market may s\neem advantageous due to having fewer competitors, but in reality, such markets come with both pros and cons. Companies must invest more resources and effort than many might think to maintain their leadership and meet the ever-increasing consumer expectations.\nSo, the answer to the question, \"Is it easier to sell when there are fewer competitors?\" is clearly \"No.\" The true challenge does not lie in the number of competitors, but in the scale of investment required and the high expectations of the market.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

The pandemic has forced organizations to adapt and find new ways of working. One of the concepts that has gained\nimmense popularity is\n\"Hybrid Working,\"\nwhich involves alternating between work in the office and work from home. Even today\n, many organizations continue to adhere to this work model, and new-generation employees are increasingly seeking\nwork-from-home jobs.\nMany have discovered that the combination of working from home and going to the office better enhances their work-life balance compared to going to the office every day, while also saving costs in various areas.\nTherefore, the qu\nestion arises: Is hybrid work model the stand\nard for modern work? And why should organizations adapt to the new normal by changing their work models? Let's\nWhat is Hybrid Working?\nHybrid working is a work model that allows employees to alternate between work in the office and work from home (or ot\nher locations) as appropriate.\nThis concept combines the advantages of working in the office and remote work, focusing on flexibility and productivity.\nIn\na hybrid working setup, employees may have a predetermined schedule specifying office days and work-from-home days or have the freedom to choose their work locations based on the needs of their tasks and persona\nl preferences. This depends on the organization's policies and the nature of each position.\nThe Benefits of Hybrid Working That Appeal to New-generation Employees\nImproved time and personal life management\nThe hybrid work model enables\nemployees to effectively balance their work and personal lives. The freedom to choose where to work helps reduce stress from commuting and increases time for family or hobbies, leading to an overall improvement in quality of life and higher job satisfaction.\nCost savings\nWork from home on cer\ntain days allows employees to save significantly on expenses, especially commuting and food costs, which can be high for those working in large cities. Additionally, it reduces expenses related to dressing for office work.\nIncreased efficiency and creativity\nHybrid working provides employees with the opportunity to select work environments that suit them and the nature of their tasks each\nday, enabling better focus on their work and stimulating creativity and innovation.\nReduced fatigue from commuting\nFor employees who live far from the office, reducing the number of days spent commuting significantly alleviates fatigue and stress from traffic congestion, allowing them to have more energy and motivation for their work.\nReasons Why Organizations Should Adopt Hybrid Working\nTo attract and retain talented personnel\nCompanies are currently competing to attract highly skilled personnel. Offering a hybrid work model serves as a key selling point for organizations, especially among new-generation workers who prioritize flexibility. Furthermore, it helps organizations retain tale\nnted employees longer since they experience higher job satisfaction.\nTo promote a modern organizational image\nImplementing hybrid working demonstrates that an organization is modern, understands employee needs, and values work-life balance, which enhances its public image and attracts quality clients and employees.\nTo improve efficiency and reduce costs\nHybrid working enables\norganizations to lower expenses related to space and utilities, as it is not necessary to have workspace for every employee simultaneously. It also enhances overall work efficiency, as employees are more satisfied and motivated.\nTo prepare for change\nThe work environment is rapidly changing. Adop\nting hybrid working allows organizations to remain flexible and ready to handle unforeseen situations, such as pande\nmics or natural disasters that may impact office work.\nTo expand recruitment opportunities\nHybrid working open\ns opportunities for organizations to hire talented employees from around the world, not limited to those in close proximity to the office, leading to a broader and higher-quality recruitment pool.\nFuture Trends of Hybrid Working\nAccording to surveys and predictions from experts, there is a clear trend that work-from-home jobs will become an increasingly prevalent work model in the future, supported by the following factors:\nHybrid workplace is gaining acceptance from leading organizations\nMajor companies in the technology sector, such as Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, have officially announced\npermanent hybrid working polic\nies. This trend is likely to encourage other organizations to consider adopting this model as well.\nBecoming a basic requirement for new-generation workers\nMillennials and Gen Z, who will become the primary workforce in the future, place great\nimportance on flexibility and work-life balance. As a result, hybrid work is the model that best meets their needs.\nChanges in urban structure\nHybrid working may lead to a more disp\nersed distribution of housing and workplaces, reducing congestion in large cities and stimulating the economy in suburban areas or smaller towns.\nIncreased emphasis on health and well-being\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, people are placing greater importance on health and well-being.\nHybrid working addr\nesses this need by reducing the risk of disease transmission and enhancing employees' quality of life.\nIn summary, the hybrid work model is likely to become a s\ntandard for modern work. Despite some challenges, the benefits in terms of flexibility, productivity, and employee quality of life make this work model increasingly desirable. However, organizations must remember to plan carefully, invest in appropriate technology, and foster a corporate culture that supports flexible working to prepare for the transition into a new era of work that may change irreversibly.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

But today, all these things have become so normal that we've almost forgotten how life was before technology changed it all.\nSo, what about the future from here? What\nnew innovations\nwill shape our world? This article will take you on a journey through the\n\"10\nMegatrend\ns of\n2025\"\nset to shake up the world in the coming year. These aren’t just speculations; they are emerging trends that have already shown clear signs of becoming the driving force for massive change!\n﻿\n10 Megatrends of 2025 That Will Open New Horizons in the 6.0 Era\n1. Generative AI as Both a Golden Opportunity and Risk for Business\nGenerative\nAI\nis rapidly revolutionizing technology and business sectors and will become one of the most signi\nficant megatrends in 2025. This innovati\non will bring both opportunities and challenges to organizations. On one hand, it can enhance efficiency, spark new ideas, and create unprecedented business opportunities, such as high-quality content creation in record time, big data analysis for insights, and the development of products and services that better meet customer needs. However, it also presents risks, including data security concerns, copyright issues, and potential impacts on the labor market. Businesses must develop strategies to leverage Generative AI ethically and responsibly, preparing for possible shifts in workforce dynamics.\n2. Climate Action as an Urgent Mission, Driving Businesses Toward Sustainability\nClimate change has intensified, making it an urgent mission for all sectors, especially businesses, to adopt more\nsustainable models\n. This shift is not only a social responsibility but also a business opportunity. Companies need to invest in clean technology, develop eco-friendly products, improve production efficiency, and set clear greenhouse gas reduction targets, all of which are becoming standard for businesses of all sizes.\n3. Rising Inflation: Impact on Costs, Consumer Spending Power, and Monetary Policy\nAnother megatrend for 2025 is i\nnflation, which is expected to have wide-reaching impacts on the economy, increasing production costs, reducing consumer purchasing power, and influencing central bank policies. To cope, businesses will need to refine cost management strategies, create flexible supply chains, and develop products that meet consumer needs in times of decreased purchasing power. Staying informed on\neconomic\nand financial policies is crucial for long-term business planning.\n4. Demographic Shifts: Preparing for a Multi-Generational Society\nDemographic changes are leading to a new\nmegatrend—a mo\nre age-diverse society. While some countries are becoming aging societies, others still have large youth populations. These shifts will significantly impact the labor market, social welfare, and consumption patterns. Businesses should develop products and services that cater to all age groups, create inclusive workplaces for multiple generations, and innovate in health and eldercare technologies, tapping into important business opportunities.\n5. Rapid Technological Advancements\nTechnologies like AI, IoT, 5G, Quantum Computing, and Biotechnology are transforming all areas of society and the economy, creating new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and solutions to global challenges. Organizations need to closely monitor\ntech advancements\n, invest in relevant technologies, and build digital skills within their teams while fostering a culture of innovation.\n6. Shift in Global Economic Power with Greater Roles for Asian Countries\nAsian countries, particularly China and India, are playing increasingly influential roles on the global economic stage, impacting trade, investment, and consumption patterns worldwide. Businesses must adapt their strategies to leverage opportunities and address challenges from\nthis megatrend. Und\nerstanding the culture, consumer behavior, and legal frameworks in Asian markets can increase chances of success. Building partnerships with regional companies is also a key strategy for expanding markets and accessing new innovations.\n7. Rapid Urbanization: Economic Opportunities and Innovation, but with Challenges\nMajor cities are becoming hubs for innovation, job creation, and economic growth, yet they also face resource management, pollution, and social inequality challenges. Businesses should adapt to meet urban consumer needs by developing smart city solutions and supporting sustainable urban initiatives, including investments in sustainable infrastructure, clean technology, and efficient public transportation systems.\n8. Hybrid Work as the New Norm\nHybrid work, combining remote and in-office work, will become a global megatrend in the\nfuture of work, enhancing flexibility and productivity for employees. Consequently, organizations must develop remote work-friendly technological infrastructure, foster a culture that supports hybrid work, and strengthen distributed team management skills. This will help attract and retain talented employees over the long term.\n9. Transition from Fossil Fuels to Clean and Renewable Energy: A Key Step Towards a Sustainable Future\nInvestment in solar, wind, hydrogen energy, and energy storage technologies will significantly increase, along with stricter policies on greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses must adapt by investing in clean energy technologies, improving energy efficiency, and creating eco-friendly products and services. This transition also presents new business opportunities in the production and distribution of clean energy, the development of energy infrastructure, and energy management services.\n10. Revolutionizing Transportation with Electric Vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles, and Shared Mobility\nThe development of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility concepts will greatly impact the automotive industry, transportation infrastructure, and urban lifestyles. To stay competitive, businesses in the automotive and transport sectors need to invest in electric vehicle and autonomous driving technologies, expand EV charging infrastructure, and establish business models that embrace shared mobility.\nUnderstanding and adapting to t\nhese megatrends will be esse\nntial for the success of governments, businesses, and people worldwide in the near future. As an entrepreneur, you should prepare to embrace change, invest in innovation, and develop new skills to take advantage of opportunities and effectively handle the challenges that will arise in 2025 and beyond.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

This leads to wasted time on non-essential tasks and missed opportunities for innovation. Effective time management is a crucial skill that allows professionals to focus on high-value tasks and achieve the best possible outcomes.\nDiscover 6 proven time management techniques that can help increase work efficiency. If you're ready to transform your work habits and enhance productivity, let's get started!\n6 Time Management Techniques to Increase Work Efficiency\n1. Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritizing Tasks Effectively\nThe Eisenhower Matrix is a time management technique developed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former President of the United States. This method helps professionals and business leaders categorize tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing them to manage multiple responsibilities effectively.\nTasks are divided into 4 categories:\nImportant and Urgent (Q1):\nCritical tasks that require immediate attention, such as emergencies or approaching deadlines.\nImportant but Not Urgent (Q2):\nStrategic planning, long-term projects, and personal development.\nNot Important but Urgent (Q3):\nMeetings, requests from others, and tasks that can be delegated.\nNot Important and Not Urgent (Q4):\nTime-wasting activities like excessive social media use without purpose.\nTo maximize efficiency with the Eisenhower Matrix, focus primarily on Q2 tasks, as they provide long-term value and reduce future urgent crises (Q1). Delegate Q3 tasks whenever possible and minimize or eliminate Q4 tasks.\n2. The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle): Focus on High-Impact Tasks\nThe Pareto Principle, or 80/20 rule, states that 80% of results come from just 20% of efforts. When applied to time management, this means that a small portion of tasks contribute to the majority of success.\nTo apply the Pareto Principle effectively:\nAnalyze all tasks and identify which ones yield the highest impact.\nPrioritize and allocate time to the most impactful tasks.\nReduce or eliminate low-value tasks that consume time without significant returns.\n3. The 1-3-5 Method: Structuring Daily Priorities\nThe 1-3-5 Method is a simple yet one of highly effective time management techniques that helps professionals balance their workload and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This method ensures a sense of accomplishment while maintaining realistic daily goals.\nEach day, focus on:\n1 major task –\nA high-priority task that requires significant time and effort.\n3 medium tasks –\nImportant tasks that need attention but are not as demanding.\n5 small tasks –\nQuick, necessary tasks that can be completed efficiently.\nBusiness leaders can adapt this approach by planning their workload in advance at the beginning of each week for better clarity and focus.\n4. Eat Your Frog: Tackling the Toughest Task First\nThe \"Eat Your Frog\" method, inspired by Brian Tracy’s book and Mark Twain’s famous quote, encourages professionals to complete their most challenging task first thing in the morning. The rationale is that once the hardest task is done, the rest of the day will feel much easier.\nYour \"frog\" refers to tasks that are:\nThe most difficult\nThe most tedious\nThe most important\nOften procrastinated\nThis technique is particularly useful for entrepreneurs handling high-stakes negotiations, critical decision-making, or complex problem-solving.\n5. Deep Work: Maximizing Productivity with Focused Work Sessions\nCal Newport’s Deep Work concept emphasizes the importance of focused, distraction-free work to enhance productivity and creativity.

It also re\nquires identifying the right timing and capitalizing on emerging startup trends. Entrepreneurs who can accurately seize these opportunities may transform themselves from emerging startups into leaders in the business world, making them interesting startups to watch in the coming years.\nLooking ahead to startup trends in 2025, it’s clear tha\nt current innovations go beyond merely producing goods and services to meet consumer demands. They focus on developing products that pave the way for a new future—one that benefits consumers, the people around you, and yourself. Consulting with experts in\ndigital consulting\ncould be a pivotal step to help you better recognize opportunities and challenges, setting you on the path to success.\n8 Interesting Startups to Watch in 2025\n1. Government Software\nOne of the fast-growing startups in 2025 is focused o\nn developing software for government agencies. Although it is a challenging market to enter, it offers immense potential, as demonstrated by Palantir, with a market value of $125 billion. This trend is driven by governments seeking ways to cut costs and improve efficiency, particularly through AI solutions for administrative tasks such as form filling, application reviews, and document summarization. Governments currently a\nllocate massive budgets for these tasks, making this one of emerging startup trends to watch.\n2. Public Safety Technology\nWith growing societal concerns about safety, startups developing public safety technologies are gaining traction. A prime example is Flock Safety, whose license plate recognition cameras have helped solve 10% of reported crimes in the U.S. Another noteworthy player is Abel Police, which has reduced police report preparation time from hours to minutes,\nenabling officers to increase on-ground activity by 25%. Public safety innovation remains one of trending startup businesses with high growth potential.\n3. Stablecoins 2.0\nStablecoins are entering a new era of widespread adoption.\nAccording to Y Combinator\n, stablecoin transaction volumes now account for 20% of Mastercard's, with nearly 30% of cross-border transfers utilizing this technology. Leading financial institutions like Visa are developing platforms for banks to issue their own stablecoins. Stripe’s $1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge highlights investor enthusiasm, making stablecoin technology a clear candidate for\nthe list of startups to watch in 2025. Op\nportunities in this space include platforms for businesses to manage stablecoins and tools for developers to integrate stablecoins into their systems seamlessly.\n4. LLMs for Chip Design\nThe rise of AI has driven demand for highly efficient chips, positioning chip design as a national priority in many countries. AI-powered solutions, such as OpenAI O1, have shown the potential to revolutionize science and engineering, particularly in designing ASICs and FPGAs. These AI-designe\nd chips deliver 5-100x higher performance and consume 10-100x less power than traditional processors. This intersection of AI and hardware innovation is a groundbreaking field and a critical focus for startup trends in 2025.\n5. Fintech 2.0\nDespite challenges over the past two years, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and tightened regulations, Fintech startups are poised for a comeback in 2025. With new infrastructure like Stripe and stablecoin technology, starting a fintech business is now easier than ever.\nAI tools\nare transforming the financial sector, giving newer startups without legacy systems a competitive edge in creating global financial products. Key growth areas include insurance, investment banking, wealth management, and cross-border payments. This resurgence places fintech firmly among\nthe fast-growing startups of 2025.\n6. New Space Companies\nSince SpaceX revolutionized satellite launch costs, reducing expenses by over 10x, the space industry has become more accessible. Startups can now build and launch satellites with a single round of funding, opening up possibilities akin to air travel or trucking in the future.\nBacked by organizations like Y Combinator, companies such as Astranis (satellite communication), Relativity Space, and Stoke are thriving. Success rates for space startups now rival or surpass those of software companies, making space exploration one of the most interesting startups to watch in this year.\n7. AI-Aided Engineering Tools\nThe engineering tools for designing physical systems, from CAD/CAM to CFD software, have seen little advancement in decades. These tools often require complex simulations, significant computational resources, and highly specialized expertise. With next-generation AI capable of under\nstanding mathematics and physics, engineers can now design systems—such as aircraft, buildings, circuits, chips, and satellites—faster and more efficiently. This innovative field is reshaping engineering and is among the top trending startup businesses to monitor.\n8. One Million Jobs 2.0\nAs AI disrupts traditional roles, businesses focused on creating one million human jobs that AI cannot replace are emerging as a powerful trend. Historically, technological shifts have transformed labor markets, often leading to better work conditions and entirely new roles. Startups in this space are likely to develop tools enabling individuals to start local businesses o\nr provide online and offline services, fostering human-centric economic opportunities. This aligns with the goal of balancing automation with sustainable job creation, making it one of emerging startup trends in 2025.\nAlthough the world\nof startups in 2025 is filled with opportunities, it cannot be denied that challenges abound as well. If you can identify and act on emerging startup trends ahe\nad of others, it will enable you to become a leader in this competitive arena with confidence and poise. Partnering with a\ndigital consulting\nexpert can be a valuable resource to help you gain a clear perspective and overcome challenges with confidence.\nChoose the trend that suits you and prepare to soar into a bright future that no one can stop, starting today!\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",
