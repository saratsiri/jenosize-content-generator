    "content": "<\nBack\nBehavioral Design: The Strategy for Designing Behavior\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n555\n0\nBehavioral Design: The Tips for Designing Customer Behavior\nDid you know? Consumers can be influenced to change their behavior through something as simple as design—no coercion, no explicit guidance, just the creative shaping of an environment that fosters conversions!\nBehavioral design is a gr\noundbreaking concept set to revolutionize innovation. It sits at the intersection of psychology, design, and\ntechnology\n, transforming how we think about influencing society. Let’s dive deeper into h\now behavioral design is c\nonnected to marketing and how it can drive impactful change.\nWhat is Behavioral Design?\nBehavioral design, literally translated as “designing behavior,” closely aligns with its practical application in marketing. It refers to the strategic and effective design of experiences, products, or services aimed at influencing and changing the behavior of target audiences.\nThis concept integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines—psychology, design, and technology—to create measurable outcomes. Behavioral design is not just about aesthetics; it’s about crafting purposeful environments that guide actions and drive desired results.\nThe Three Key Components of Behavioral Design\n1. Behavioral Psychology\nUnderstanding the decision-making mechanisms of the target audience is fundamental to\nBehavioral design\n. Marketers need to thoroughly analyze both the motivations driving actions and the barriers preventing behavioral change. By identifying why people do or don’t engage in certain behaviors, marketers can design more precise and effective solutions.\n2. Experience Design\nEnvironments and touchpoints have a significant influence on user behavior. Effective design should create experiences with the following characteristics:\nFacilitate desired actions.\nSimplify usability and reduce complexity.\nProvide motivation through appropriate rewards, such as promotions or discounts.\nFeature clear and intuitive UI/UX design.\n3. Data Analytics\nIn the era of\ndigital transformation\n, leveraging big data and machine learning is essential for tracking and measuring behavioral changes. These tools enable marketers to analyze and improve customer experiences while predicting future behaviors and market trends. By using data-driven insights, strategies can be refined for maximum impact.\nKey Techniques in Behavioral Design\n1. Nudge Theory\nThis theory focuses on subtly “nudging” or stimulating the thoughts, feelings, or actions of the target audience through clever design that guides decision-making without forcing or limiting user choices. For example, placing healthy food prominently in a cafeteria encourages people to choose healthier options simply by increasing their visibility.\n2. Gamification\nThis involves incorporating game mechanics and elements into non-game contexts to foster engagement and motivation. Examples include point systems, unlocking achievements, competing with others, or earning rewards. Gamification is widely used in designing digital products and services because it effectively drives user participation.\n3. Choice Architecture\nThis concept emphasizes designing how options are presented to users, aiming to help them make better decisions. It is based on the understanding that human decision-making is not always rational and is often influenced by the presentation of information and contextual factors. Marketers must carefully consider how to structure and present choices to optimize outcomes.\nPros and Cons of Behavioral Design\nPros of Behavioral Design\nEnhances behavioral change:\nBy leveraging proven psychological principles, Behavioral Design naturally and effectively influences human behavior.\nCreates user-centric experiences:\nDesigning with real user needs and behaviors in mind leads to higher satisfaction and fosters long-term engagement.\nMeasurable and systematic improvement:\nThe use of data and in-depth analysis allows for systematic measurement and continuous refinement of outcomes.\nCost-effective in the long run:\nProper design reduces the need for costly corrections, increases user retention, and strengthens brand loyalty, ultimately saving resources over time.\nCons of Behavioral Design\nRisk of perceived manipulation:\nSome consumers may feel their behavior is being controlled or overly influenced. Transparency in design is essential to mitigate this concern.\nResource and time intensive:\nBehavioral design\nrequires significant investment in research and data analysis during the development phase, though it often proves worthwhile over time.\nUncertain and time-dependent outcomes:\nHuman behavior is complex and unpredictable, often influenced by uncontrollable external factors. Achieving results throug\nh behavioral design requires p\natience and consistent effort.\n﻿\nBehavioral Design in Real-World Business Examples\nSpotify\n,\na standout example of\nbehavioral design in the music streaming industry. The platform uses algorithms to analyze individual user beha\nvior, such as which songs are played, skipped, or added to playlists. This data is then processed to create a personalized music experience, encouraging users to continue engaging with the app based on their preferences and listening habits.\nDuolingo\n, a language-learning platform, effectively use\ns behavioral design to keep users engaged in their lessons like a game. The platform employs a streak system\nthat motivates learners to return daily to maintain their learning streak. It also breaks lessons into small, manageable units that can be completed quickly, making users feel a sense of progress and accomplishment, which helps sustain their learning habit.\nAs a new-generation marketer, always remember that we're not just designing products or services; we are designing the experiences and consumer behaviors that drive business results. However, when applying behavioral design to marketing, it is crucial t\no consider ethics, respect privacy, and uphold human rights to demonstrate sincerity towards consumers. This approach is essential for achieving long-term success in the marketing world in a sustainable manner.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

These areas frequently experience large-scale earthquakes capable of causing significant damage to life, property, and public infrastructure. In response, the Japanese government and research organizations have been actively advancing cutting-edge technology to strengthen early warning systems and reduce the devastating impacts of natural disast\ners. One of the most promising developments in recent years is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in earthquake preparedness—specifically for prediction, analysis, and systematic response.\nReal-Time AI Technology for Earthquake Epicenter Detection\nOne breakthrough innovation is an AI earthquake prediction system developed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). This system accurately detects the epicenter of earthquakes occurring along the Nankai Trough. Previously, location estimates could deviate by up to 20 kilometers, but the AI has reduced that margin to just a few kilometers—calculating it within only five seconds.\nThis AI earthquake prediction in Japan uses 3D seismic wave data from high-risk zones to provide real-time analysis. It enables agencies like the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue timely earthquake or tsunami warnings, significantly increasing response speed.\nHigh-precision data in the critical seconds after an earthquake strikes is crucial to minimizing loss of life and property, allowing for faster evacuations and emergency responses.\nAI Earthquake Preparedness Models for Soil Stability and Liquefaction Risk\nAnother significant development is a 3D soil analysis model created by the Shibaura Institute of Technology. This AI earthquake preparedness system uses Artificial Neural Networks and Assembled Learning to evaluate the risk of liquefaction—a phenomenon where the ground turns into liquid due to seismic vibrations. This condition is a major cause of structural collapse in coastal and soft-soil areas.\nThe model enables:\nUrban planners to identify “safe zones” for construction.\nEngineers to design structures suited to the soil profile of each area.\nLocal governments to implement comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures.\nStrategic Business and Government Benefits of Earthquake Preparedness in Japan\nAI in earthquake preparedness is more than an engineering tool—it also serves as a strategic asset for businesses and public sector planning:\nSite selection:\nHelps assess seismic risk before investing in office buildings or warehouses.\nInsurance planning:\nInforms premium negotiations through detailed risk analysis.\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP):\nProvides accurate data to build emergency response strategies.\nUrban alert systems:\nMinimizes social and economic disruption by enabling faster evacuation in densely populated areas.\nExpanding the Role of BCP in the Thai Business Context\nFor Thai businesses, particularly those operating factories, energy grids, or large warehouses in risk-prone zones, having a BCP is critical. AI systems that analyze seismic history and soil composition in real time can help executives:\nChoose safer locations for expansion.\nRelocate or segment critical operations.\nBuild more resilient supply chains.\nAdditionally, AI simulation tools can model scenarios such as seismic vibrations or evacuation routes, allowing organizations to create actionable BCPs that reduce potential harm to people and operations during unexpected events.\nOpportunity for Thailand to Adapt Japan’s Model\n﻿\nAlthough Thailand is not located in a major seismic zone like Japan, tremors can still occur—particularly in the North and West due to proximity to neighboring countries. In recent years, earthquakes have even been felt in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Sawan, and Phuket, including a notable event on March 28, 2025.\nAdopting learnings from AI earthquake prediction in Japan offers Thailand several benefits:\nDeveloping a domestic early warning system.\nUsing soil data for urban planning and structural design.\nEnhancing business resilience against climate and natural disasters.\nOne promising initiative could involve applying Japanese AI models in high-risk provinces like Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Tak. These areas have reported tremors from Myanmar, and collaborations between geoscience agencies, universities, and local governments could lead to 3D soil modeling and the installation of deep seismic sensors—setting the foundation for a robust national disaster response system.\nPrivate-sector companies in real estate and infrastructure can also utilize this data to build safer, more sustainable projects aligned with long-term development goals.\nJapan’s strategic use of AI to manage natural disasters—especially earthquakes—demonstrates how real-time, data-driven analysis can save lives and improve resilience. These technologies are not only essential for public safety but also for empowering businesses and governments to prepare for an uncertain future. If Thailand can adapt these innovations into its own national planning, the result could be a smarter, safer, and more stable society.\nFor organizations looking to implement advanced\ntech solutions for businesses\n.\nJenosize\nis ready to be your trusted technology partner.

    "content": "<\nBack\nAI Search Marketing: How to Keep Your Brand in Search?\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n505\n0\nAI Search Marketing: Boosting Brand Visibility in the AI Era\nFrom the familiar Google search everyone knows, we now have AI-driven search engines that can synthesize information and provide answers tailored to the user’s needs instantly. Whether it’s ChatGPT, Bing Copilot, or Google SGE (Search Generative Experience), these tools present answers that go beyond just listing results from websites. They offer responses that take into account the user's intent and the reliability of the information.\nIn an era where AI plays a central role in information retrieval, adapting to AI Search or\n\"AI Search Marketing\"\nhas become increasingly important. This process ensures that your brand \"appears\" in the answers that AI presents, enabling you to directly reach customers and increase business growth effectively.\nWhat is AI Search Marketing?\nAI Search Marketing is a marketing strategy focused on ensuring your brand \"appears\" or is featured in the responses AI generates when answering user questions. Unlike traditional search engines that pull information solely from websites or databases, AI can now also retrieve data from various other sources such as forums, social media, and open-source databases. This diversity makes AI responses more comprehensive and varied.\nSimply put, AI Search Marketing isn’t just about providing information on your website; it’s about ensuring that your data is selected by AI to be used as an answer—one that aligns with the user’s intent and presents a suitable solution.\nHow Does AI Search Marketing Differ from SEO?\nBoth SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and AI Search Marketing aim to appear in user search results, but they have clearly different approaches and processes:\nSEO to Rank on Google:\nSEO focuses on optimizing a website so that it ranks on traditional search engines like Google. This involves improving content quality and using relevant keywords.\nAI Search Marketing to Be Selected by AI:\nIn contrast, AI Search Marketing focuses on getting your brand’s information selected by AI to be used in its responses. AI pulls from a variety of data sources, such as website content, forum discussions, or social media conversations.\nBehind the Scenes of AI Search\nAI Search Marketing relies on complex processes to synthesize data from multiple sources in order to provide the most accurate and appropriate answers to users. Key steps in this process include:\nUsing Data from Multiple Sources:\nAI pulls from websites, forums, social media, and open-source databases to create the most relevant answer.\nUser Intent Analysis:\nAI analyzes the intent behind the user’s query—whether they are looking for general information, recommendations, or step-by-step guidance (How-to).\nAnswer Synthesis:\nAfter gathering information, AI selects and synthesizes the most relevant and accurate response to meet the user’s needs.\nHow to Do AI Search Marketing and Ensure Your Brand Appears in AI Responses\n1. Create In-Depth and Accurate Content\nCreating detailed content that thoroughly answers user questions is a core strategy in AI Search Marketing.

Regularly Update Content\nAI tends to favor fresh, up-to-date content. Regularly updating your website ensures your brand's content remains relevant and timely. This could include adding industry updates, addressing frequently asked questions, or correcting errors in older content.\nCase Study: Brands Successfully Using AI Search Marketing\nIn recent years, several brands have succeeded by leveraging AI Search Marketing, particularly within digital marketing and SEO sectors. These brands have attracted attention from AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and other AI platforms.\n1. HubSpot\nHubSpot provides an all-in-one inbound marketing platform that includes tools for CRM, content creation, and digital campaign management. By creating content that answers user questions on various topics like SEO, digital content creation, and online sales techniques, HubSpot has become a go-to resource for AI when responding to queries about marketing.\nHubSpot’s use of Structured Data makes it easy for AI to access and present their content. Regular updates ensure the information remains relevant to current trends and user needs.\n2. Moz\nMoz, a well-known brand in the SEO industry, uses AI Search Marketing effectively by providing in-depth content related to SEO tools and strategies. Their content often comes in the form of Q&A, How-to guides, and expert advice, making it easy for AI to feature Moz’s resources in search results about SEO.\nThe benefits of AI Search Marketing are vast. It enhances your brand's visibility in AI-powered search engines, directly targets users with high-quality, relevant answers, and improves the chances of increasing engagement and conversions. Brands that align their content strategy with AI search capabilities not only improve their search ranking but also become more relevant to users’ needs, driving business growth.\nBy quickly adjusting your strategies to work with AI, partnering with a\ntech agency\nthat specializes in data analysis and digital marketing can ensure your strategies are both effective and up-to-date. This will give you a competitive edge and open up more opportunities to grow and expand your customer base in today’s digital world.\nLoading...\nUnbox Future\nOpportunities Together\nBrief Us\nQuick & Easy Submission\nRespond Within 24 Hours\nChat with Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nCall Sales\nAvailable Monday to Friday\n9 AM to 7 PM (GMT+7)\nวันนี้ให้เราช่วยอะไร?\nBrief Us\nCall Sales\nConnect in LINE\nChat with Sales",

    "content": "<\nBack\n9 Experiential Marketing Trends to Watch in 2030\nTechnology\nMarketing\nBusiness\nAD\nBy:\nJenosize.com\n23\n0\n9 Experiential Marketing Trends 2030 Businesses Must Know\nCustomer experience is no l\nonger just about providing good service. It has become the cornerstone of marketing strategy across all sectors—whether in SMEs, retail businesses, or government organizations. But have you ever wondered how experiential marketing trends in 2030 will evolve? With cutting-edge technology as a key driver and consumers expecting more complex, higher standards from brands, the landscape is set for a dramatic shift.\n9 Experiential Marketing Trends 2030: What Consumers Will Expect in the Future ?\n1. Merging the Physical and Digital Worlds (Merged Reality)\nMerged Reality is set to eliminate the divide between “offline” and “online” experiences. Using Mixed Reality (MR) technology, consumers will engage with brands through a hybrid of physical and digital experiences. For example, retail stores might allow customers to try on products from home using MR glasses, or government service centers could offer simulations to teach citizens how to navigate bureaucratic processes. This trend creates new touchpoints that foster a deeper connection with brands—regardless of location.\n2. Immersive, Participatory Experiences\nExperiential marketing in 2030 will move beyond presentation and into full-on participation. Consumers won’t settle for passive advertising—they want to be “players” in the brand experience. Immersive technologies like 360° environments, multi-sensory interaction, and spatial audio will be key features in product demonstrations, events, and even government training. These experiences go beyond visuals to build meaningful, emotional connections with participants.\n3. AI and Automation for Personalized Communication\nAI and machine learning will become core brand ambassadors. Beyond answering questions or recommending products, these technologies will interpret customer needs, communicate naturally, and deliver hyper-relevant experiences. Think human-like chatbots, real-time virtual hosts at events, or auto-generated personalized content based on user context. Strategically implemented, AI will allow brands to offer care and precision that once seemed impossible.\n4. Hyper-Personalization Becomes the New Standard\nHyper-personalization isn’t just about addressing customers by name in emails. It means deeply understanding each individual’s life stage, emotions, and needs at every touchpoint. Brands will use data from multiple sources—click behavior, in-store movement, even health data—to create personalized experiences. For instance, sending a fitness promotion to someone who just joined a gym, or dynamically adjusting app UX to match a user’s style.\n5. Digital Trust as the Foundation of Experience\nBy 2030, trust will no longer be optional—it will be expected. Consumers will choose brands that prioritize transparency and data protection. For experiential marketing 2030, this means building on digital ethics: clear consent policies, data transparency, and secure systems. Brands that fail to deliver on this front, no matter how compelling their experiences, risk swift backlash from consumers and society.\n6. Loyalty Programs as Lifestyle Ecosystems\nLoyalty programs will evolve far beyond points and rewards. They will become ecosystems supporting long-term relationships, integrating with health services, travel, or social initiatives. Customers will enjoy benefits that align with their lifestyle—like converting online shopping points into online course discounts or charitable donations. In experiential marketing trends 2030, brand loyalty will be defined by how well brands support their customers' personal goals.\n7. Digital-First Experiences as the Core Strategy\nFuture products and services will be designed with digital experience at the core—not as a supplementary channel. Picture branchless banks offering fully integrated mobile apps or shopping malls with AR platforms enabling customers to browse from home. A digital-first mindset enables brands to scale efficiently, reduce costs, increase flexibility, and meet the needs of digitally native consumers.\n8. Omnichannel Will Become the Norm\nConsumers will expect seamless experiences across all platforms and physical spaces. They want brands to “remember” and “understand” every interaction—be it a website chat, an in-store purchase, or an event registration. A unified omnichannel approach ensures consistent messaging and functionality, increasing satisfaction and driving repeat purchases.\n9. Sustainability as a Core Principle in Tech Design\nTechnology that performs well must also respect the planet. Experiential marketing in 2030 will spotlight sustainable practices—monitoring the carbon footprint of digital campaigns, efficient use of cloud systems, energy-saving hardware choices, and low-waste events. Brands that demonstrate real environmental commitment and embed ESG principles into their experience design will earn greater consumer loyalty.\nExperiential marketing 2030 goes far beyond using digital tools—it’s about creating a “new world” where brands and consumers connect deeply through immersive technology, AI, trust, and sustainability.
